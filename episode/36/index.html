<p>Hi, this is Reinhard from Everyday systems.com
</p>
<p>Welcome to part 2 of the mods and tweaks trilogy.
</p>
<p>If you didn't listen to part 1, you're going to have no idea what I'm talking about today so please go back and listen to that first.
</p>
<p>Last time, I tried to discourage you from tweaking a system you have in place unless you've given it a good long time and really feel it's not working.
</p>
<p>I used this legal analogy, of an "everyday system" being like the constitution. And I emphasized the AUTHORITY that this analogy is supposed to invoke.
</p>
<p>The constitution is the law of the land. You have to respect and obey it.
</p>
<p>This time I'm going to be talking about the other thing suggested by the constitutional analogy: the fact that you can make amendments. 
</p>
<p>And how to do it.
</p>
<p>With some specific examples, taken from no-s.
</p>
<p>But enough about analogies already and on to the practical details.
</p>
<p>I think there are two questions about making amendments to your habit systems.
</p>
<p>One is "what kinds of amendments should I make? Are there any common characteristics that good mods and tweaks tend to have?" 
</p>
<p>I'll talk about this at the end of this episode. 
</p>
<p>And it'll also spill over into the next episode, when I'll talk about design principles for coming up with new everyday systems from scratch. 
</p>
<p>There's significant overlap.
</p>
<p>The second question is "what should the process for making these amendments be?"
</p>
<p>And I think this question of "process" is the more important of the two. 
</p>
<p>Because if you come up with a good process, then you can afford to be wrong about the first question now and then.
</p>
<p>If a particular mod-experiment fails, you can recover from it.
</p>
<p>The ammendment process I'm going to suggest builds on an idea that I've talked about before, of making monthly resolutions.
</p>
<p>It works like this:
</p>
<p>You adopt the system I described before in a previous episode, monthly resolution.
</p>
<p>If you missed that episode, don't worry, it's very simple. 
</p>
<p>The basic idea is that instead of making big new years resolutions once a year, as many people do, not very successfully, usually, 
</p>
<p>you make up to 1 smaller scale resolution every month.
</p>
<p>The episode on monthly resolutions goes into more detail as to why this is a good idea in general, and I encourage you to listen to it, 
</p>
<p>but for now I'm just going to focus on how to apply it to the system amendment process.
</p>
<p>Which is also very simple. A mod counts as your resolution for the month.
</p>
<p>You only get one resolution of any kind, mod or otherwise, so this makes you consider whether your tweak is worth that one opportunity. 
</p>
<p>It puts a cost on your tweak, which forces you to think about it more carefully than you might otherwise: "artificial scarcity."
</p>
<p>It also puts a limit on how fast and furious your tweaks can be. 
</p>
<p>Even if you're like, "whatever, I can't think of any other contenders for resolutions this month, might as well blow it on 
</p>
<p>whatever random crazy tweak that pops into my head,"
</p>
<p>You only get one a month, so there's a limit as to how much dangerous novelty you can introduce. Only one random crazy tweak. 
</p>
<p>One can be plenty bad, don't get me wrong. But it's better than 3 or 5 or 10.
</p>
<p>So on the positive side, with Monthly Reslution governing your ammendment process, 
</p>
<p>you get qualitatively better tweaks, because of the pressure of artificial scarcity. 
</p>
<p>And on the negative side, you get quantitative protection from potentially bad tweaks, because they're limited in number.
</p>
<p>So what do you do at the end of the month?
</p>
<p>You decide whether or not the mod was helpful. 
</p>
<p>Were you able to comply with it? Was it reasonable humane? Did it mess up your compliance with existing rules? 
</p>
<p>Were the results at least not the opposite of what you'd expect?
</p>
<p>Because you only change one behavior, it should be not exactly easy, but easier to get a sense as to the impact it had, if any.
</p>
<p>If you'd changed multiple behaviors, it would have been very difficult. 
</p>
<p>If the mod doesn't pass muster, drop it. Don't feel guilty. This was an experiment. You committed to a month, that was it. 
</p>
<p>Any contractual obligation is at an end.
</p>
<p>Go ahead and give it the 21st amendment. Repeal it.
</p>
<p>What if you find yourself having trouble with it DURING the month?
</p>
<p>I think it depends on the level of trouble.
</p>
<p>If it's a minor pain, I'd say try to tough it out. 
</p>
<p>Sometimes, usually, even a good tweak will take some initial toughing out, and you might be surprised that it gets easier after a bit.
</p>
<p>But even if it doesn't get easier, toughing it out for a month has some advantages. First off, it's an exercise in willpower. It'll buff you up. 
</p>
<p>Secondly, it'll make you think twice about your next tweak. 
</p>
<p>If you know you're going to have to struggle with something for a solid month, you're going to take it more seriously.
</p>
<p>Where I'd draw the line is if the tweak is messing up your compliance with previously established rules.
</p>
<p>If you were doing vanilla no-s with good compliance, added a mod, and then find your compliance with vanilla no-s going to hell, drop the mod immediately. 
</p>
<p>Pre-existing rules always come first.
</p>
<p>A few clarifications:
</p>
<p>I don't mean one tweak per system per month.
</p>
<p>I mean one tweak per month period.
</p>
<p>I mean one resolution of any kind per month period.
</p>
<p>So if you're doing no s, shovelglove, and urban ranger, you have to choose which one you're going to tweak. 
</p>
<p>The others have to get in line for a future month.
</p>
<p>And If you're adding a whole new system in a given month, don't also tweak an existing one. 
</p>
<p>Or if you have any other kind of monthly resolution that's going to be your primary focus, don't pile this on top. 
</p>
<p>It's ok to wait till next month. You're not going to be able to solve all your problems now. 
</p>
<p>For now, you want to keep the number of innovations you're adding in any given month to a manageable level.
</p>
<p>That way you can more clearly see if your tweak is having an impact, 
</p>
<p>and you can give your tweak (and your existing rules) the attention they need to have a chance of succeeding.
</p>
<p>Novelty, a new behavior, is not just risky, in that it might not work. 
</p>
<p>It's also expensive, even if it works out eventually, because no new behavior starts out as a habit.
</p>
<p>It takes weeks or months of practice to automate a new behavior into habit.
</p>
<p>That means weeks or months where you have to spend precious willpower and attention on it. 
</p>
<p>Willpower and attention are very finite commodities.
</p>
<p>If you change or add more than one behavior a month you run a very real risk of overdrawing your available funds.
</p>
<p>Sure, you might sometimes be able to pull it off, but look at it from the perspective of a lifetime.
</p>
<p>All you have to do is overdraw your fund of willpower and attention once and all your systems come crashing down. You do not want to risk that.
</p>
<p>So get into the habit of budgeting your willpower and attention within your means.
</p>
<p>Also, you don't HAVE to tweak something every month. Zero tweaks is fine. Zero tweaks is better than one.
</p>
<p>Use your monthly resolution to get some project done instead. Or experiment on a new habit system.
</p>
<p>If at any point you run into serious compliance trouble, consider REMOVING a rule rather than adding one.
</p>
<p>Even if your rules are all individually good, the sum of them can be way less than the parts -- even something negative --
</p>
<p> if you don't have the energy and attention they require. 
</p>
<p>The priority should always be compliance with existing rules. 
</p>
<p>If your compliance starts suffering after adding something new, the solution isn't to add yet more, 
</p>
<p>but reduce your total "rule burden" back to the point where you could deal with it. 
</p>
<p>If the precise details of the "monthly resolution" amendment process I've just described don't do it for you, that's ok, 
</p>
<p>I think it's totally fine to come up with different precise details.
</p>
<p>But I do think that it's important to have precise details of some kind worked out. 
</p>
<p>That it is, in fact, a defined process, and not just a smokescreen for whatever you feel like doing.
</p>
<p>And that these details somehow or other, take into account the importance of "willing within your means" and "paying attention within your means."
</p>
<p>OK, before I completely run out of time, some characterics of good mods, with examples -- and counter-examples.
</p>
<p>Almost all the mods I touch on here are described in far greater detail by the people who actually thought of them on the "No S Mods" 
</p>
<p>sticky thread at the top of the bulletin board or elsewhere on the boards.
</p>
<p>So look there if any of these mods sound intriguing, or to find mods I won't have time to go into here, or to share your own mods.
</p>
<p>I've divided the characteristics of good mods into 5 rules.
</p>
<p>Rule #1. You should know what kind of problem your mod is going to address.
</p>
<p>I'm talking very high level here.
</p>
<p>Is it a results problem or a compliance problem?
</p>
<p>A results problem is when you have no trouble following the rules -- they just don't seem to be getting you the results you want.
</p>
<p>Your habitcal is solid green (with specks of yellow) but your scale hasn't budged in months.
</p>
<p>A compliance problem is when you can't even quite get yourself to follow the rules to begin with. 
</p>
<p>There's a lot of red in your habitcal.
</p>
<p>This will obviously also quickly become a results problem. But you can't jump to worrying about results before you even get compliance down.
</p>
<p>In a way, compliance mods address a more fundamental problem.
</p>
<p>But I think results mods are more dangerous. Because it's so easy to get overambitious with them.
</p>
<p>Before you proceed any further, you should be clear in your head which of these problems you have, and whether, after listening to the last episode, 
</p>
<p>"to mod or not to mod," you still want to run the risk of making an amendment. Especially if you're considering a results mod, 
</p>
<p>9 times out of 10, patience is better than any mod 
</p>
<p>Ruler #2. A mod should make the smallest possible change that might actually be effective. The bigger the change, the bigger the risk.
</p>
<p>Don't oversolve your problems. That never works. You have to solve them just enough, or it's unsustainable.
</p>
<p>And the surest way to do that is to take tiny steps.
</p>
<p>Rule #3. A mod should work with the existing rules.
</p>
<p>Part of this is for the sake of clarity about what you're doing, part is just stylistic.
</p>
<p>The aesthetics of your rule systems actually do make a motivation difference.
</p>
<p>So on no-s, don't just not contradict the existing rules, but work with the ideas of "s-things" and "s-days" for stylistic consistency.
</p>
<p>One very common no-s mod is not really a mod at all: change the number of meals. 
</p>
<p>No-s doesn't actually REQUIRE 3 meals, though it's what most people do, and a good default.
</p>
<p>But people who find themselves getting too hungry between meals can add a 4th mini meal, for example. 
</p>
<p>There's a risk to this, in that it makes it easier for excess to creep in, but if you can't comply with 3 meal no-s, 
</p>
<p>then it's a risk worth taking, because the alternative is simply failure.
</p>
<p>This is an example of a compliance inspired mod.
</p>
<p>Other people find they have no problem with 3 meals and think they could manage with just 2.
</p>
<p>This would be (presumably) a results inspired mod.
</p>
<p>Some people have had fantastic success with 2 meals no-s. James, I think has lost over 100 pounds doing this (and shovelglove). 
</p>
<p>But I'd be very careful. A mere 2 meals could easily turn into serious deprivation and/or a total compliance collapse.
</p>
<p>Another natural opening for mods in no-s has to do with those "no seconds" plates.
</p>
<p>Some people have a rule for how big their plates (or at least, the plates they normally use at home) should be. 
</p>
<p>The idea being that plates have gotten rather enormous these days, and that eating off a smaller, say 9 or 10 inch plate, would make excess stand out more.
</p>
<p>I don't do it myself, but it makes intuitive sense that this might help. 
</p>
<p>And it seems like something you could implement with a single shopping trip rather than incessant hand wringing:
</p>
<p> just buy those 9 or 10 inch plates and get rid of the rest.
</p>
<p>I guess the down side is that's an expensive gamble.
</p>
<p>Another family of plate-mods involves plate division. What fraction of your plate to devote to veggies, protein, and starch, for example. 
</p>
<p>I personally find that my eyes are sufficient to detect any gross imbalances in terms of what's on my plate, 
</p>
<p>but this is something a lot of people have mentioned as being helpful. 
</p>
<p>When to take S-days is another natural opening for no-s (and shovelglove) mods.
</p>
<p>In one sense, everyone customizes no-s in this regard because no two people celebrate the exact same holidays, vacation, etc.
</p>
<p>But some people take their regular weekend S-days on other days to match their work or religious schedule.
</p>
<p>Or take a single regular S-day a week.
</p>
<p>Kathleen has a very interesting mod that involves accumlating non-weekend special days, sort of like employees accumulate vacation days at work.
</p>
<p>Every month, she accumulates 2 special days that she can take whenever she chooses -- even retroactively after a failure.
</p>
<p>As long as she has some special accumulated, she can't fail. A failure day just comes out of her reserve of unused s-days.
</p>
<p>The advantage to this is that she has a buffer from the potentially demoralizing sense of failure. 
</p>
<p>The downside is a little extra keeping track, 
</p>
<p>and potential confusion about what I think is a real difference between planned exemptions and unplanned slip ups. 
</p>
<p>But it seems to be working great for her. And it's been a while now, so, maybe something worth considering if it appeals to you.
</p>
<p>Another results inspired mod is to add a forbidden S: like "no starch." 
</p>
<p>Some people have had great success with this (Davestarbuck, I think, has lost 65 pounds doing this at least part of the time). But I'd be VERY careful.
</p>
<p>Because 4) a mod should be also be clear and humane.
</p>
<p>And I think it's easy for "no starch" to become confusing and cruel. 
</p>
<p>Starch is in a LOT of food. And it's not immediately obvious where. You have to start checking ingredients, etc. 
</p>
<p>A painful process even apart from the deprivation aspect of it.
</p>
<p>I do not want to knock the success some people have had with this, obviously you have figured this out for yourselves, 
</p>
<p>but just to issue a general warning to the uncommitted against diet hubris.
</p>
<p>If you want to do something like this, I think it's safer to maybe tighten up your definition of "sweets," 
</p>
<p>by counting some previously borderline substance like say orange juice as a sweet,
</p>
<p> than to add a whole new category of restriction.
</p>
<p>It's a smaller, safer change, and doesn't actually change any of the existing rules -- it just interprets them a little more narrowly.
</p>
<p>Don't jump to this, of course.
</p>
<p>Only tighten the no-sweets rule if you think you're really having a problem with some borderline Sweet. Even small tweaks have their risks.
</p>
<p>Other people do the opposite of tightening restrictions. 
</p>
<p>For the sake of compliance, they allow some precise, reasonably healthy kind of food to be "exempt" from the no-s rules, 
</p>
<p>promoting it to the OK status that caloric beverages like orange juice have on no-s.
</p>
<p>"Too Solid Flesh" has reported great success doing this with cottage cheese.
</p>
<p>Others have reported doing this with fruit, though I'm not sure how that's panned out. 
</p>
<p>I suspect fruit, though it sounds like the perfect exempt food, 
</p>
<p> may be a problem because then bulky healthy fruit will tend not to make it on your meal plates,
</p>
<p> where it competes for space with less healthy, more fattening stuff.
</p>
<p>Another common family of no-s mods is to add some, shall we say, clarity to what your S-days should look like. 
</p>
<p>Although a tempting opening for mods, this too, can get dangerous fast. 
</p>
<p>I covered these in the S-days gone wild episode I did on the subject last year, so for now, I'm just going to refer you to that.
</p>
<p>5) Never add a mandatory restriction when a positive default will do the trick.
</p>
<p>Restrictions are risky. They demand attention, and it's demoralizing when you fail to follow them.
</p>
<p>They're necessary, to a degree. But they can quickly become overwhelming.
</p>
<p>So consider supplementing your rules, if they need supplementing, with positive, optional defaults instead. 
</p>
<p>These can be intelligent dietary defaults, like I've discussed in a previous episode, or a habit of intentionally rewarding away resentment on S-days,
</p>
<p> like I discussed in S-days gone wild. 
</p>
<p>You can even consider re-spinning some of the restrictive mods above as defaults. 
</p>
<p>The plate size rule, for example, is a terrible rule if it requires you to carry around your own plate with you wherever you go. 
</p>
<p>Or if you have to bust out a tape measure before you can decide whether to accept your hosts hospitality at a dinner party.
</p>
<p>But if get a few smaller plates at home and say, "when I'm at home, on N-days, this is what I'm going to eat from by default."
</p>
<p>That's a lot more humane and realistic, and there's not a lot of downside risk.
</p>
<p>There are many, many other mods I could discuss here. But we're in serious overtime as it is. 
</p>
<p>Next episode: the conclusion of the mods and tweaks trilogy: what to do when a mere mod isn't enough, 
</p>
<p>how to come up with a new everyday system from scratch: the fundamental principles of systematic moderation.
</p>
<p>Thanks for listening.
