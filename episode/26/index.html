<p>Hi, this is Reinhard from everyday systems.com. Today I'm going to
talk about a system that I've been practicing almost as long as any of
my other systems, since early 2002, a system I've gotten fantastic
benefits from, but that I've never adequately described anywhere on
the website.</p>
<p>I call it audiodidact. It's like autodidact except audio instead
of auto. On its most basic level it's using sound recordings to teach
yourself stuff. I'm not crazy about the name, and that's one of the
reasons I haven't pulicised it much yet, but it's useful enough and
proven enough at this point that I think it's worth discussing in a
bit of detail.</p>
<p>There are two components to audiodidact. Input and output. Input is
very simple: I listen to a ton of audiobooks. Output is where it gets
more interesting. Among other things, I carry around a digital voice
recorder with me on my urban ranger walks to record todos, random
ideas that pop into my head, and keep a kind of audio diary. It's very
therapeutic. Autotherapeutic. Kind of like having your own shrink,
except without the hundred and fifty dollar an hour charge.</p>
<p>I'll talk about the simple part first.</p>
<p>I was an English lit major and trained to be a librarian. Now I sit
all day in front of a computer. When I come home, there are a thousand
practicalities to attend to: dishes, vacuuming, laundry, etc. I miss
reading, and dread the dull chores that now take up my free time
instead. The solution? Audiobooks. I know a lot of people who listen
to books on tape during long commutes, and if I drove much, I'd do
this too. But where books on tape really shine for me is in these
little nooks and crannies of time when I am doing some mind numbing
chore. Not only do I get more "reading" done than I ever did before,
but formerly dreaded chores become positively pleasurable.  I now
actually love doing dishes and vacuuming because they're an excuse to
listen to audiobooks.  And I am thorough like I'd never be if I
weren't dying to find out what happens to Teddy Roosevelt next, etc. I
don't want to stop.</p>
<p>The great thing is there is no downside to this. There is no cost
or trade off. I couldn't really productively be doing anything else
with my attention at that moment. It is surplus attention that would
have been wasted otherwise. The listening doesn't compete with other
more active things I have to do. In fact, it helps, by making mindless
chores more bearable.</p>
<p>Another time that I find audiodidact helpful is when I'm walking
home from work. An audiobook snaps me out of work mode so I can stop
obsessing about my job and give my family the attention they deserve
when I get home. I hate it when I catch myself thinking about java
code when I'm playing legos with my daughter, and but thanks to
audiodidact, it doesn't happen much.</p>
<p>Here's another time when audiodidact comes in useful. I tend to
have very little trouble falling asleep. But when I do, an audio book
will knock me out in minutes. I don't know if that will work for hard
core insomniacs, but give it a try. Worst case scenario you listen to
something interesting for a while.</p>
<p>What do I listen to? Among other things, a lot of teaching company
stuff. These are recorded lecture series by professors on varioius
subjects. I mostly get them from the public library. This is not an
expensive habit. In fact I save money because I've essentially stopped
buying books. I don't know how typical my library system is, but here
in cambridge you can request books on line from any branch in a pretty
extensive library network and have it delivered to your local branch
for pickup. It's almost like a free amazon.com. I also listen to a lot
of foreign language stuff (mostly German, but some french and a tiny
bit of hebrew). Foreign language podcasts have been fantastic for
this.</p>
<p>Some people seem to think that listening is qualitatively inferior
to reading. That the written word is somehow a purer medium. This is
nuts. If anything, it's the other way around. We think of the written
word as this old fashioned, quasi sacred thing in comparison with say
the internet, but writing was once high tech too. Writing is just a
very lossy compression and storage technology for speech. And in the
same way that we worry about the effects of modern media technologies,
the ancients worried about the technology of the written
word. Socrates thought it would make people stupid because they
wouldn't have to remember things any more. And in fact, this founder
of western philosohpy never wrote anything. He just went around
talking to people.</p>
<p>Silent reading is an even more recent innovation than
writing. People used to read everything out load. St. Augustine,
writing about 800 years after Socrates, was amazed when he saw that
his mentor, St. Ambrose, could read silently, without even moving his
lips.</p>
<p>I don't want to knock the written word. I am very happy that Plato
wrote down what Socrates said about the dangers of the written word or
we never would known anything about it. I just want to defend
audiobooks from misguided literary puritans who say that speech
somehow interferes with words. Yes, mp3s and wmas and aacs maybe new,
but listening is as old school as it gets. School of athens old
school.</p>
<p>I'm out of time for today. I'm going to have to save audiodidact
output for a future podcast. Thanks for listening.</p>
