<h2>No S Diet Rules</h2>

<p>Hi, this is Reinhard from everydaysystems.com. Last week I gave a
high level overview of the no s diet to give you a sense of how
something this simple could possibly work. I hope I at least convinced
you to suspend disbelief. This week I'm going to zoom in a little to a
smaller scale and go over each of the rules in a bit of detail. </p>
<p>In case you missed last weeks episode, or just to refresh your
memory, here are the rules again: </p>
<p>No snacks, no sweets, no seconds. Except (sometimes) on days that
start with S.</p>
<p>I'll start with the exception: days that start with S. On S days,
the training wheels come off, you're free to eat whatever you
like.</p>
<p>What days start with S? Well, Saturday and Sunday are the obvious
ones. The other kinds of, perhaps not so obvious S days are "Special"
days. Special days are major holidays. National holidays, religious
holidays, birthdays of close family and friends. You woundn't have
dieted on these days anyway, you might as well feel good about it. It
might as well be part of the rules instead of against them, because
otherwise it would be a built in failure mechanism, a self
destruct. Dividing weekdays from weekends and holidays is a very
natural, clear, and practical division. And I've found this concept of
S days versus non-S days (or N-days, for short) useful for many other
systems beyond no-s.</p>
<p>S-days are a safety valve, an incentive to keep you motivated, and
a reward. They're critical to making no-s work. If you don't give
yourself s days you're going to crack. People worry about binging on S
days, that they'll eat so much that it will undo all their good
behavior on N days, but from what I've seen, this is far less of an
actually danger than people attemping to be overstrict. If you're good
on N-days, that's a lot of goodness. That makes a difference in itself
that's hard to undue in just a small fraction of the time unless
you're concsiously trying to sabatage yourself. It also creates
unconsious habits that gratudally start to carry over into the
weekend.</p>
<p>I stuck the word "sometimes" in the exception just to remind you
not to be an idiot. You can follow these rules to the letter but still
stuff yourself if you are really determined to. But I don't think you
can do it by accident -- you'd really have to be trying. Some people
on the website have found it useful to attach more specific meanings
to the word "sometimes," but for now I'll just leave it at "don't be
an idiot."</p>
<p>Rule # 1: No Snacks. This is probably the most contentious
rule. Most diets today tell you snacks are good. That you should eat
lots of little meals instead of a few big meals because you'll
metabolize them more efficiently. And they have *a* point. Under
laboratory conditions, people who eat a controlled amount of calories
over the course of many small meals or snacks do metabolize them more
efficiently than people who eat the same amount of calories in the
traditional three meals. But studies have shown that in real word
conditions people who snack wind up eating a lot more calories. So
they might metabolize them more efficiently, but they eat so much more
that they still get fat. So unless you live in a cage in a lab with a
scientist measuring out precisely controlled portions for you,
snacking isn't going to work.</p>
<p>It it makes sense that snackers eat more. Because when there are
lots of input opportunities, it's harder to monitor them. It's like if
your a country that has big border with a problematic neighbor -- a
big border is hard to defend.</p>
<p>Snackig makes self deception easy -- it doesn't just ryme with
sneaking. It facilitates it. No one, including yourself, can ever
point to you at one moment in time and say "hey, right now you're
eating too much!" Except for the fact that you're fat, you can put on
a very convincing charade.</p>
<p>But even if you aren't actively trying to deceive yourself, but
carefully count every calorie in order to trick your metabolism to run
at this higher rate, sort of like overclocking you CPU, snacking is a
bad idea. Because counting is just too much work -- really boring
work. It requires an unsustainable amount of attention.</p>
<p>Stick with single plate meals and you get a shortcut to measuring
how much you are eating that is accurate enough to be useful, but
unobtrusive enough to be sustainable. You don't need to count, you can
eyeball how much you're eating. And after a while, you barely have to
do that. Because It becomes habitual. Counting, arithmetic, is never
going to become an unconsioius habit.
<p>Snacking is also not a historically normal human activity. We've
been so brainwashed by marketers who want to sell us snacks (you can't
sell NO SNACKS, right?) that this doesn't occur to us. But think about
it.</p>
<p>Food used to be very, very inconvenient to prepare. It was
expensive and hard to preserve. You couldn't just whip out a powerbar
when you needed an extra boost to plow the field. Almost everyone
spent almost all their time preparing food: planting it, growing it,
harvesting it, hunting it, cooking it.  When they sat down to eat the
food they'd just spent most of their waking hours preparing, it was a
big deal. It was a social event. It was formal. It was distinct from
the rest of the day. It was a meal. </p>
<p>Mealing is profoundly normal, nothing you should be afaid
of. Prettyy much everyone did it until, about 1980, to pick an
arbitrary date. About the time when everybody started getting fat. It's
snacking that is the weird, anomalous behavior that needs justifying,
that only people in fat societies indulge in.</p>
<p>On to rule #2. No Sweets is the only rule that targets a specific
substance (all most diets do) but there's a critical difference from
the usual dietary substance prohibitions. Because No-s allows sweets
on weekends and holidays, it's not so much a prohibition as a
recasting of sweets from the routine staple they've become back to
their traditional role as "desserts." What does the word "dessert"
mean, after all? Something deserved. The no sweets rule turns the
weakness of a sweet tooth into a motivating strength.  Temptation
becomes incentive. You can resist the temptation because you know you
can have it later. You eat less, and when you get to legitamately eat
the temptation -- now no longer a temptation but a reward, you enjoy
it more. No-s works even just from a purely hedonistic point of
view.</p>
<p>Note that it's "no sweets," not "no sugar." This is an important
distinction. By sweets I mean something where the principal source of
calories is added sugar: cookies, pop tarts, soft drinks, candy bars,
etc. You don't have to go checking lists of ingredients and driving
waiters crazy, your taste buds will let you know. If you have to
wonder, it's probably OK. By just targeting the really egregious
offenders you'll be cutting out a shocking amount of calories. By not
making yourself crazy over borderline cases you'll be that much more
likely to stick with the plan. You don't need to cut out all sugar, or
even all sweets, and certainly not all carbs. No sweets on N days is
enough. Don't try to do more than enough. You'll be miserable and
you'll fail. </p>
<p>Rule #3: No Seconds. No Seconds means limit each meal to one
physical plate. You can fit a lot onto a plate, but you can't do it
without seeing that it's a lot. That gentle pressure on your eyeballs
is surprisingly effective. In the beginning, some whopping plates are
to be expected. That's part of the educational process. Because you
can't sneak your excess anymore, because it confronts you head on,
your whopping plates will gradually shame you into less whopping
ones.</p>
<p>Don't worry about plate size at all when you're starting out --
except to make sure that you're putting enough on, a little too much
is ok. The important thing is to build the habit and eat enough to see
you through to your next meal without snacking.  In time, you'll get
very good at budgeting how much it takes to do this without hunger or
excess. So it's ok if that means some really big plates at first. If
it takes you a few extra calories up front to buy the habit of
structured, mealtime eating, they're calories well spent.</p>
<p>I've actually got a ton more to say about the no s diet, but I'm
out of time for today, and I think I should probably say a little bit
about the other everyday systems before devoting any more podcasts to
No-s. So next week I think I'll talk about my sledgehammer exercise
routine, shovelglove.</p>
