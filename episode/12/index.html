<p>Hi, this is Reinhard from everyday systems.com. Last week I talked
about using a structure called the habit traffic light to keep track
of your habit while you're building it. Today I'm going to talk about
how long you should continue using the habit traffic light, and what
to do (if anything) when you stop.</p>
<p>What I recommend on the web site is to keep track for at least 21
consecutive successful days. Or at least 21 non-failure days (exempt s
days are counted with successes for the purpose of racking up the 21
days). 21 days is about how long it takes to start a habit. I have no
idea where this absurdly precise number comes from, I certainly didn't
come up with it, it's floating around all over the place on the
internet. But I have a feeling it's more or less accurate, and worst
case scenario, it's a useful, motivating fiction.</p>
<p>Because, of course, there isn't really a precise dividing line
between a non habitual behavior and a habit. Habit isn't a binary
on-off thing, it's gradual. But after 21 days of practice, your
behavior will certainly be more habitual than it was on day
1. Probably a lot more.</p>
<p>And having a precise number to shoot for is motivationally
important. That's how our silly minds work. And we aren't going to get
one of these motivationally necessary precise numbers without it being
a little arbitrary. 21 days has the advantage that it's long enough
for some serious habituation to take place, but short enough to feel
attainable. It's certainly not a bad number. Neither are 19, 20, or
22. But 21 has an aura of authority, if only from having been repeated
so often, and it's also numeralogically, aesthetically, and culturally
attractive. If you're some totally rational logical Mr. Spock who is
unimpressed by such considerations, I have to wonder how you developed
such irrational illogical problems like being fat and out of shape to
begin with.</p>
<p>So what do you do after 21 days? Some people on the everydaysystems
bulletin board like to continue keeping track with the full habit
traffic light. The habit traffic light is pretty unobtrusive, and
still a little helpful, so they don't mind. Some people just stop
keeping track. They feel confident enough in their habit to forgo the
expense. And that's fine too. Maybe that's even the best
scenario. Honestly I didn't keep any kind of track until several years
into my systems. I started up mostly because people posting to the
bulletin boards were clamoring for some way to keep track and I wanted
to see if I could come up with a low cost way to do it -- low enough
cost that I could do it myself, for several systems, for a long period
of time.</p>
<p>And it worked reasonably well. Even I, will very mature habits, got
some motivational benefit from it, and it wasn't too much of a
pain. But I discovered (pretty recently, actually) that is that
there's an even better way of habit tracking than the habit traffic
light once you've gotten past the initial hump and established your
habit. I call it negative tracking. It's like a simpler version of the
traffic light. You only report the failures. So red light, or no
light. Habit traffic light is better for new habits, but negative
tracking is better for maintenance.</p>
<p>Here's the rationale. When you first start out trying to turn a new
behavior into a habit, every successful day is "information" and worth
noting. The behavior is novel, and by default, you wouldn't have been
doing it. If you succeed, it's news. If you fail, it's news. If you
take an exempt day, it's news. Anything except completely ignoring
your new behavior is news, and those are the options. </p>
<p>But tracking takes effort, even if it's only a minimal "days on
habit," and after a while, once you've successfully established your
habit, it's no longer very informative. The default has changed. The
default is now, not nothing, not undefined null, but success. Keeping
explicit track of this default takes effort and doesn't tell you
much. Success is implicit. Failures now become the only interesting,
unusual, newsworthy thing. You can now switch to recording just these,
saving effort and clutter and without losing information.</p>
<p>It's not just a good value over positive tracking, you don't just
get the same thing for less, you get more. Since keeping track is a
pain, good behavior is rewarded by not having to keep track, bad
behavior is punished by having to do so. So negative tracking gives
you an additional incentive to behave. This is magnified since because
you're now only keeping track of the bad, it stands out more, it's
more obvious and shaming.</p>
<p>Negative tracking sounds like a downer, but it's really very
optimistic: it assumes the default is success. No news is good
news.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, positive tracking is best when your habit is
young. But for most of our lives, hopefully, we'll be maintaining
established habits rather than struggling with new ones. For that, I
think negative tracking can be an even better way to go. It's almost
as cheap as no tracking, and provides even more benefits, for a mature
habit, than positive tracking.</p>
<p>That's it for today. Even if you don't think these particular
frameworks for habit tracking will work for you, I hope I've been able
to get you thinking in new ways about the issues involved. Bye for
now. </p>
