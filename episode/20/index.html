<p>Hi this is Reinhard from everydaysystems.com. As you may know from
earlier podcasts, my exercise routine, shovelglove, takes just 14
minutes every weekday. Schedulistically insignificant time, is what I
call this. Just a quick recap, 14 minutes is one minute less than the
smallest granularity of time you'll find on any calendar. You never
have a meeting that starts at 9:05 or 9:14. You have no excuse not to
do this. I don't want to bore longtime listeners by going over it in
great detail, so please dig up the shovelglove podcasts if you want to
hear more about this. Today I'm going to talk about what to do on days
when you don't even have these 14 minutes -- or think you don't. And
I'm also going to try to sell you on the idea of using this time
structure -- 14 minutes every weekday -- for your workout routine even
if you're not doing shovelglove. So it might be worth paying attention
even if you're not into the idea of swinging around a
sledgehammer.</p>
<p>First off, when you find yourself thinking "I don't even have 14
minutes" today, try a little enlightened self mockery. Do you really
not have 14 minutes, or are you just feeling a little lazy? 14 minutes
is a comically short amount of time for something that is, big
picture, very important. Let the ridiculousness of that arbitrary 14
remind you to ask yourself, am I being ridiculous? And to an extent,
it's a rhetorical questions. Of course you're being ridiculous. If
there's not a baby that needs to be rushed to the hospital or a
terrorist bomb about to explode you have 14 minutes.</p>
<p>If, after giving this a shot, you fail to see the humor in the
situation, try sober calculation. Your excuse may be silly, but the
problem is serious. It may not seem like it, but missing just one day
in your routine can have serious big picture implications. Because
you're not just losing one day's calorie buring and muscle building,
that wouldn't matter so much, the real loss, or potential real loss,
is the habit you're risking. Because when you're good, every time you
do shovelglove or whatever your exercise routine is, when you're
supposed to do it, it's not just a good in itself, the calories burned
or whatever, it's a link in the chain of habit. When you skip it,
there's a link missing, the chain is broken. The linking aspect of
your behavior is actuallly more important than the physical results of
the behavior itself. Unlike an ordinary, you know, metal chain, habit
can recover from this kind of thing. But why risk it?  Why play
roulette with not just today's exercise, but all future exercise? You
think "oh, todays 14 minutes of exercise doesn't mean much in itself."
And you're right. But nothing is just in itself.</p>
<p>The philosopher Imannuel Kant had this moral idea called the
categorical imperative. It goes like this: something is right for you
to do if the result of everyone doing it would be good, bad if the
result of everyone doing it would be bad. You take a particular action
and imagine what would happen if everyone started doing it, and that's
how you distinguish good from evil. There are some obvious problems
with this line of thought, but I think it's still useful, even when
just applied internally, to yourself. Imagine a personal categorical
imperitive. What would happen if the decision you are making now, this
once, whether to exercise or not to exercise, applied not only to just
this once, but also to all the times in the future when you're in this
same situation? Forget about other people, we're just considering you
yourself. I think you'll realize, if you reflect a bit, that it's not
such a hypothetical question, because in a way your decision now does
affect all future decisions. When you make the decision to be lazy,
you make it easier to be lazy next time, and easier, and easier, as
you keep deciding that way. That's the way habit works. If you decide
to be virtuous, you make future virtue easier and more likely.</p>
<p>If neither enlightened self mockery nor sober calculation is
sufficiently persuasive, tell yourself that anything is better than
nothing and just start swinging that sledge (or start doing whatever
your exercise is). Tell yourself that all you have to do is 10
minutes. Or 5 minutes. Or 1 minute. Whatever pitifully low number it
takes to seem non-threatening enough to get you started. Because
starting is by far the hardest part. Once you start, your outlook vis
a vis the 14 minutes may change completely. And even if it doesn't,
even if all you do is 10 or 7 or 2 minutes, you get some exercise, and
you've kept the habitual link. It may not be the strongest link in
your chain, but it's there. That is hugely important. </p>
<p>If you're tracking your habit using the habit traffic light or
negative tracking like I've talked about in previous podcasts, tell
yourself that if you just get started, you'll count it as a success,
even if you don't wind up doing the whole 14 minutes. This is a big
motivator, because no one wants to mess up their winning streak, and
all you have to do to keep it going is to just start.</p>
<p>9 times out of 10, I'll finish the 14 minutes then, even if I
didn't think I had them. The world changes after that first swing of
the sledge. Reality changes. And since the 1 time in 10 I don't quite
finish enables the rest (plus gives me a few minutes of exercise which
is better than nothing) I'm willing to count it as a success with a
clear conscience.</p>
<p>For those of you listening who don't do shovelglove and
realistically aren't ever going to start swinging a sledgehammer
around, 14 minutes every weekday can still be a very useful structure
to regulate your exercise. It's long enough to give significant
physical benefit, and short enough so that you'll actually do it. In
fact, I'd go so far as to say if you had an exercise routine where the
only explicit requirement was that you do *something* for 14 minutes
every weekday, without even specifying in advance what that something
should be, just exercise of some kind, you could get into great shape
-- without any equiptment. I speak from some, limited experience,
because when I'm on vacation, traveling, and I don't have access to my
sledgehammer (airport security can be a real pain about
sledgehammers), that's exactly what I do.  Pushups, squats, jumping
jacks, the wall of pain. Whatever I can think of from high school gym
class. And I'm usually completely exausted halfway through. 14 minutes
doesn't seem like a lot of time, but think about it. I don't care how
strong you are, how many pushups you can do, 14 minutes is more than
enough time for you to do them to utter exaustion, and then some, and
that will get you very strong. Making the time, that little bit of
regular time, is by far the most important component of an exercise
routine. What you actually do, the movements, is a detail. It's funny
because every exercise routine, makes the movement or the device seem
most important. But it's really the time. So why not explicitly say,
I'm doing the time, the 14 minute exercise plan instead of the
movement, whatever it is.</p>
<p>That's all for today. Thanks for listening.</p>
