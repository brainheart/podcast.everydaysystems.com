<h2>Glass Ceiling</h2>

<p>Hi, this is Reinhard from everydaysystems.com, and today I'm going
to talk about glass ceiling, my system for smoothing out dangerous and
humiliating binge drinking into healthy and pleasurable moderate
drinking.</p>
<p>Before I talk about how great it is, I'm going to have to try to
scare you off a bit. "Glass ceiling" is not intended for people who
suspect they may be serious alcoholics. Common as that problem may be,
I'm not going to call it "everyday." If you have any doubts, see
alcoholics anonymous .org or talk to you doctor or find some other
some other support group. "Glass ceiling" isn't gonna do it for
you. And I don't want be responsible for distracting you from seeking
the stronger medicine you need. Please keep looking, but don't look
here.</p>
<p>Ok, so what is the problem I'm trying to solve?</p>
<p>Occasional binge drinking.</p>
<p>What I mean by this is most of the time you're fine, you can drink
like a normal person, it's not like every time you drink you get out
of control, but every once in a while you get absolutely smashed, and
find yourself in dangerous, humiliating trouble. Your schadenfreude at
reading about Mel Gibson is tempered by the realization that the
difference between you and him is that you're not famous.</p>
<p>The obvious solution is to just stop drinking. Quit cold
turkey.</p>
<p>There are two problems with the cold turkey strategy.</p>
<p>One is that research is increasingly showing that moderate drinking
is ridiculously good for you. Moderate drinking is defined as a drink
or two a day, depending on how big you are.</p>
<p>The other is that moderate drinking is a great pleasure. Now
pleasure alone might not do it -- tobacco is also a great pleasure and
I acknowledge that with tobacco cold turkey makes a lot of sense -- ,
but for moderate alcohol consumption, with its clean bill of health,
the claim of pleasure is real and legitimate.</p>
<p>So how do you balance this if you're given to these occasional
binges, and still want to get the health and pleasure benefits of
moderate drinking?</p>
<p>A two drink a day absolute maximum. No more than too glasses a
day. That's your glass ceiling. Yes, there's fudge room. But not so
much fudge room that you're going to wind up in jail or in the
emergency room.</p>
<p>It's like the one plate rule in the no-s-diet. On the one hand,
it's very clear. One plate is clearly different from two. Two glasses
are clearly different from three. On the other hand, there is wiggle
room. You *can* pile a mountain of food onto one plate and you *can*
get one of those enormous Bavarian beer steins and fill it up with
everclear, but you can' t do either without seeming like an
astonishing glutton or drunkard. You can't hide your excess in lots of
dainty little increments, and excess, when it's out in the open like
that, is embarrassing, it's disgusting, even to just yourself, it's
shameful.</p>
<p>Shame has a bad wrap these days, but shame can be good. I feel like
the Gordon Gecco of self help saying this, but it's true, and
importantly true, I think. Shame has been around for all of recorded
history and probably then some. It isn't going anywhere. You might as
well use it instead of fighting it or pretending it doesn't
exist. It's powerful. Make shame your ally and in diet and in drinking
and in many other things, shame will keep you reasonably moderate.</p>
<p>I know I said that shame can or should kick in even without other
people around to be witnesses, but if you're the type of person who
does a significant amount of drinking alone, you have a serious
problem, and glass ceiling isn't going to solve it. Please do yourself
a favor look somewhere else for a solution.</p>
<p>OK, other ambiguities and potential loopholes...</p>
<p>No refills. This should go without saying, but common sense
sometimes has trouble with the obvious after a couple drinks.</p>
<p>And no saving up. Use it or lose it. If you don't drink for ten
days that doesn't mean you can drink 20 drinks on day 11.</p>
<p>Calendar day or 24 hour day? Calendar day. For simplicity
(otherwise you'd be counting hours all the time), and to allow for the
occasional date spanning 4 drink event. Yes, 4 drinks is a binge. But
as binges go, it's as small as they get. If you're the kind of person
that needs a system like this, you probably would have had much more
otherwise. But if you find yourself doing this a lot, alarms should go
off. A minimal binge is better than a , but it's still not good.</p>
<p>A word of advice to those with persistent and unsympathetic
drinking buddies: don't tell them what you are doing. If you play it
cool, chances are they won't notice, especially if you alternate
between alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. A tonic and tonic looks
amazingly like a gin and tonic.</p>
<p>Conversely, when you're starting out at least, I would avoid mixed
drinks that you mix yourself. The mix is camouflage. With a dash of
cranberry juice you can bypass the shame of drinking a big glass of
vodka. Shame is your friend. Don't do that to shame!</p>
<p>If you are physically small or want to give yourself some extra
buffer, lower the ceiling to 1 drink. Or have a variable ceiling of 1
drink on N-days, 2 on S-days. But be sure you can stick with
this. Much better to abide by a liberal law than break a strict
one. If you don't like the calendar day rule, make it a 24 hour period
instead. But again, only if you really think you can keep it.</p>
<p>As with food, you'll have a much easier time exercising moderation
if you genuinely enjoy and respect what you drink. Don't view it as
drunk-juice. Drink for your palate, not your throat. You'll be
drinking less, so spend a little more and get the good
stuff. Moderation is an opportunity for greater pleasure.</p>
<p>And as an additional benefit: if you were a hardened binger like I
was, your tolerance will go way down. I can now get a nice buzz off of
two drinks.</p>
<p>I used to have a real problem. I didn't drink to excess often, but
when I did every few months or so I'd often come dangerously close to
death/divorce/making the evening news. Glass ceiling totally solved
this problem for me -- and without my having to sacrifice the benefit
and pleasure of alcohol. I haven't been more than a little tipsy since
I started this in early 2002, yet I enjoy alcohol far more than I ever
did in my drunken youth. Frankly, I'm amazed. One wouldn't think that
huge, potentially deadly problems could be solved with cutesy
puns.</p>
<p>That's it for glass ceiling. It's probably the simplest system I've
discussed yet, but it changed my life. Next week I'll take a step back
from individual, stand-alone systems that address particular problems
and talk about the big picture of habit management: how to maintain
existing good habits and add new ones without risking what you already
have. Thanks for listening.</p>
