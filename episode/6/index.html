<p>Hi, this is Reinhard from everyday systems.com. Today I'm going to
talk about Urban Ranger, a system for convincing yourself to build the
habit of purposeful walking. It's probably the everyday system I'd
choose if I had to pick just one, because it's at least as good for
the mind -- for the soul -- as for the body. </p>
<p>You've probably heard a million things about how great an exercise
walking is supposed to be. You don't need to be sold on
that. Everybody knows that. Even McDonald's is giving away pedometers
with their happy meals. (which is probably a really bad sign. by the
time McDonald's gets virtuous you know things must have gotten very bad
indeed.)</p>
<p>What you need, then, is something to get you fired up about this
humble, uninspiring activity, so you'll actually do it. You need to
convince yourself that walking is not some last ditch compromise
shadow exercise, but that it's profoundly ass kickingly
exciting. That's where urban ranger comes in. It's like a role that
you play, an alter ego. A way of re-imagining yourself so that walking
becomes the most important, the most exciting thing that you could
possibly be doing. Sound excessive? If you're like me, that's what
it's going to take to get you walking at all.
</p>
<p>I hate to do this to you, but I'm going to have to read you a poem
to make you understand. Bear with me. It's short.</p>
<h2>Song of the Urban Ranger</h2>
<pre>
I am an urban ranger,
I walk, it's what I do.
The city is my wilderness,
Sky scrapers are my trees.
I hang my thoughts on lamp posts,
And park my dreams in metered spots.
I populate the empty lots
With my good ghosts,
And invest the pavement
with diamond recollections.
Exertions are my exercise,
My labors for effect.
I walk to go and go to walk.
I walk to work and work that I might walk.
I walk to dream up orders
For my servile sitting self.
No stagnant sedentary thoughts
Shall rule this life.
But who knows what's for what.
I sure walk a hell of a lot.
</pre>
<p>Poem done. As a poem, I admit it's pretty awful. But hey I'm a
computer programmer, this the Internet, and you know the genre of
exercise poetry is not exactly overcrowded. Think of it as a jingly,
somewhat out of order table of contents for what I'm about to tell
you.</p>
<h2>First item in the table of contents: "Exertion vs. Exercise"</h2>
<p>Think about it. We've invented one class of machine to spare us
physical exertion -- all our labor saving devices -- and another class
of machine to inflict it back on us again, but infinitely more boring,
painful, and useless manner. We view it as the triumph of our age that
work no longer means labor, that we can burn fossil fuel instead of
living muscle. And then we berate ourselves that we don't labor in our
leisure time, that we don't spend our freed hours in that torture
chamber, the gym.</p>
<p>The problem is that labor isn't something we can really afford to
save. If we don't pay it out up front, working usefully, we have to
pay it back later --- in boring contrived pretend work. Which, if you
could actually convince yourself to do it, would be at least as time
consuming as real work. But most of us don't bother much with the
pretend work either. We just prefer to get fat and sick.</p>
<p>So you probably don't go to the gym, or strap yourself to the bike
machine, or grind the cartilage off your joints jogging around the
track, as often as you think you should, if at all. You suspect that
your problem is a deficiency of willpower. Well, you're off. Your
problem is you are squandering willpower on a hopeless task: exercise
divorced from purpose. The solution: purposeful exertion; in
particular, walking.</p>
<p>You probably can't kill a caribou for dinner, or plow a
field, or do most of the useful work that your ancestors did for
thousands of generations. But you can still walk. And believe it or
not, walking is enough.</p>
<p>Walking is <em>still</em> useful. It's interesting and pleasant.
You can think and observe while you walk. You get somewhere. You don't
need any special equipment or outfits. It provides great health
returns on very little investment, without the risk associated with
high impact activities. And you can do it for the rest of your
life.</p>
<h2>Next item in the poem: paraphrased, When should you walk?</h2>
<p>Walk to and from work. If you work too far from home to walk the
whole way, practice the noble sport of distance parking and walk part
of the way. Walk to run errands. Walk up stairs instead of taking the
elevator or escalator. This is urban mountain ranger. Walk during your
lunch hour. Walk when you've got cell phone calls to make. Walk to
listen to an audiobook. Walk when you're depressed. Walk when you
don't know what to do next.</p>
<p>The question should be "when shouldn't I walk?" Walking is the
default activity. It's everything <em>else</em> that needs a
justification.</p>
<p>That's the pep-thought, at least. Do what you can do.</p>
<p>Even in the suburbs you'd be surprised at all the places you can
walk to. You can be a suburban ranger. People often don't realize how
close the places they always drive to really are. Explore, give it a
shot. Be bold, you're a ranger. The less hospitable the terrain, the
more the glory.</p>
<p>And don't worry about having any special walking technique or
gear. Just walk. For the sake of your own dignity and the beauty of
the world, please don't put on any silly outfits and pump your arms
like a maniac. Just dress and walk normally. That 5% extra health
benefit or whatever that you supposedly get from pumping your arms
won't mean a thing when you stop after 3 months because you are tired
of looking like a bozo. You'll unconsciously get faster as you do it a
lot. So relax.</p>
<h2>Last item from the poem: "Orders for your Servile Sitting
Self"</h2>
<p>Nietzsche wrote: </p>
<pre>"A sedentary life is the real sin against the Holy Spirit. Only those
thoughts that come by walking have any value."</pre>
<p>You are smarter when you walk. It's not just the physical movement,
it's the changing scenery around you. I bring a digital voice recorder
along to capture my brilliant ideas, to-do lists, and diaryesque
inanities. Once a week or so I transcribe it to my computer. I thought
of most of the other everyday systems like this, while walking.</p>
<h2>So do you still think walking is for wusses?</h2>
<p>Look, If you put on bright blue sweatpants and pump your arms a lot,
going nowhere with a big goofy grin on your face, sure, I'll grant
you, it's for wusses. But that's not the kind of walking I'm talking
about.</p>
<p>Remember Strider, in Lord of the Rings? They didn't
call him Sneaker or Sprinter or Sworder, though he possessed these
skills in abundance. His distinctive quality, the important, even
lethal skill, for which he was named, was that of walking rapidly and
mindfully over great distances. Not only could he could outpace his
enemies, by his walking reconnaissance, he came to outknow them.</p>
<p>Well, you might object, that's fantasy. OK, skeptic, how did the
army of Alexander the Great get to India from Greece? They walked. How
about the <i>Grande Armee</i> of Napoleon, how did they get all the
way from Paris to Moscow?  Not on the Concorde. For thousands of years
winning a war was largely a matter of being there before your
enemy. So get the aqua sweatpants out of your mind, this is man
stuff!
<p>That's all for today. Next week I'll talk about Weekend Luddite, a
system for distraction management. Thanks for listening.</p>
