<p>Hi this is Reinhard from everydaysystems.com.</p>
<p>A lot of people on the no s diet bulletin board have been freaking
out about minor fluctuations in their weight. So I though I would pay
attention to my own weight on the scale for a few days, just so I
could collect some hard data to hopefully reassure these people that
their fluctuations are not something unusual or bad.</p>
<p>What was the result? I couldn't have made up something better.</p>
<p>Last Thursday I weighed 171 pounds. No surprise. On the website I
quote my weight as 170. I'm usually a little under when I bother to
check, but 171 is about what I'd expect. I stepped on the scale a
couple more times to confirm. 171 both times.</p>
<p>The next morning, I stepped on the scale again. This time I was 161
pounds. I had lost 10 pounds in one day. I stepped on the scale a
couple more times to confirm. Still 161.</p>
<p>I did nothing unusual. Same time of day. Same situation, right
after breakfast and exercise. And I'm not even actively trying to lose
weight. I've been maintaining for about 4 years now. And yet,
according to my scale, I lost 10 pounds, overnight, without even
trying. It sounds like one of those quick fix diet ads -- it sounds
better than one of those quick fix diet ads.</p>
<p>Do I believe this number? Do I think it is significant? Or course
not. These numbers make no sense. They are obviously just some
aberration of the scale, maybe coupled with some digestive issues. But
if I had been trying to lose weight. Or I had been gorging myself. I
might have read the numbers quite differently. Or if I'd just waited a
week in between measurements. Then those numbers might have seemed to
me very meaningful. I might have thought "aha, my diet is working!"
or "wow, I can eat like a pig and it doesn't matter!" The numbers
would have mislead me about my behavior.</p>
<p>What happened the next day, on Saturday morning? I was back to
170. I'd gained 9 or my 10 pounds back again overnight.</p>
<p>Let me just say that my scale is not particularly awful, from what
I can judge from previous experience. It's a reasonably reputable
recent vintage digital scale. "Healthometer" is the brand, which
sounds kind of ghetto, but I think it was around 90 bucks. Yes, I
might have gotten ripped off a bit, but I don't think so. I got if
from a very trustworthy local mom and pop pharmacist. It's at least as
good as any scale I'd previously owned.</p>
<p>You might be thinking, "well I have a medical quality scale" that
would never be so inaccurate. Maybe you do. Great. That's certainly
better. But I've had some bad experiences with medical quality scales
too -- scales that were actually in the doctors office. Our daughter
was a preemie, and right from the beginning, she was off the charts
small. We made ourselves crazy trying to cram enough calories into
her. When she was about a year old or so, the pediatrician told us (an
otherwise wonderful pediatrician) that she was underweight enough that
we had to take her to a feeding specialist. It turns our that the
problem was with our pedestrians scale. It was off by over 10% -- our
daughter was actually fine.</p>
<p>The point I'm trying to make here is not that scales are useless
and should never be trusted, but that they are not accurate enough
that you should make yourself crazy over day to day fluctuations. Any
single measurement is not really worth much. They also don't quite
measure the right thing. What we're interested in isn't really
weight. It's fat vs muscle, or something like that. Weight is just an
approximate way of getting at this. So not only are scales inaccurate,
but they're measuring the wrong thing.</p>
<p>Look, it's nice for me to be able to say, "I've lost 40 pounds" on
the No S Diet. I'm not knocking scales completely. But it is absurd
and counter productive the way people prostrate themselves before the
scale as if awaiting the infallible judgement of the almighty. I get
people posting losses or gains of half a pound on the everyday systems
web site. There is no way that means anything. You scale is not that
accurate, and even if it were, you might be measuring time since last
bowel movement rather than anything you really care about. The 10
pound fluctuation I had last week is extreme. But I have 5 pound
fluctuations all the time. And I see lots of people posting jubilantly
posting 5 pounds losses or dejectedly confessing 5 pound gains.</p>
<p>So should you measure waist circumference or something instead?
From what I've read about measuring waist circumference, it does seem
like a better metric. But I have to confess, I don't do it. I still
step on the scale now and then, that's still the only results based
metric I use. But it's not my primary metric. It's just a rough
occasional sanity check, and to make sure the number I quote on the
nosdiet web page isn't a total lie. My primary metric is behavioral:
days on habit. And this I think is the primary metric most people
should switch to.</p>
<p>When you step on the scale and see a 5 pound gain or loss, what do
you do with this information? How do you react? Most people get
depressed when they see a bad number-- and that all too often leads to
 "emotional eating," binging on comfort food -- although self hatred
food would be a more accurate description in this case. And when they
see a good number, the figure they can relax, take it easy, maybe
celebrate a little, eat a little more. The data -- which is mostly
random noise -- influences the behavior more than the behavior
influences the data. There are people who can take these numbers in
stride. But I think these are people who know that these numbers are
of secondary importance -- that good behavior comes first.  What do
people expect when they step on the scale? That it's some kind of
divine justice slash slot machine that might unaccountably punish or
reward them? They should expect -- filtered through a lot of random
noise -- the results of their behavior, good or bad. So why not focus
on that directly? The cause instead of the effects. Behavior, besides
being a better thing to measure, is also an easier thing to measure. I
don't have time to get into it now, but look up my podcasts on the
habit traffic light and habit tracking if you're interested.</p>
<p>I'm reading a really good diet book right now. I've never actually
come across such a think before, so this is pretty exciting. It's
called Mindless Eating, by Brian Wansink. He says that the ideal
weight loss of a successful long term dieter is about half a pound a
week. That's how much you can lose without pain and suffering,
sustainably. You can't measure that accurately on a households scale,
it's just too slow.</p>
<p>So keep the scale if you want to, but put it in perspective.</p>
<p>That's all for today. Thanks for listening.</p>
