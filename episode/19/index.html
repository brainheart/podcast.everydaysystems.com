<p>Hi, this is Reinhard from everydaysystems.com. Last week, I was a
little overambitious. I basically tried to cram two systems into one
podcast: chain of self-command and personal punch cards.</p>
<p>Today I'm going to clear up some ambiguities about both systems
that I wasn't able to resolve last week despite my rush to cram
everything in, but mostly I'm going to focus on the details of how I
do my personal punch cards. I don't have time to repeat what I said
last week, so please go back and listen to that segment if you haven't
already, because this segment isn't going to make any sense
otherwise.</p>
<p>OK. First dual system issue: The more anal among you may have been
disturbed by the unsatisfying mix of metaphors going on here. We've
got a military analogy for the chain of command, and a computer
analogy for the punch cards. It doesn't quite fit. But I think I've
figured out a way to resolve it: your chain of command army is an army
of robots, of 1960s era robots, who take punch cards. They're like the
Daleks from Dr. Who. For added motivational benefit, imagine your
punch card orders being read in that evil robot dalek voice. In case
you don't remember what this sounds like, I found a (somewhat
relevent) clip on the internet:</p>
<p>Inspiring. OK. Next dual system issue: I want to give some more
clarifications on "scope." Last week I said that as long as a rank in
the chain of command is in temporal scope, you can assume that role
and give new orders. So all of 2007 for your 2007 general, all of
January 2007 for your January 2007 officer. It's a wonderful computery
concept that I took from my dayjjob as a programmer, but it seems to
contradict the major point of the system which is to separate out
these functions so you don't countermand your own orders all the
time. When your footsoldier self doesn't like what he's supposed to
do, he shouldn't be able to all of a sudden put on a general uniform
whenever he feels like it.</p>
<p>Here's how I resolve this, and this sort of ties in with the
implementational details of what the punch cards look like which I'm
going to focus on for the rest of this segment: </p>
<p>1. once you write an order, you can't negate it. You have to do it,
or acknowledge failure. Or perhaps refine it a little, narrow it down
a little. What you write on one of these cards does not get erased. So
you can't simply countermand orders. When the scope of the card
closes, say at the end of the day for a footsoldier, you either cross
out each order, leave it uncrossed out to designate failure, or you've
scribbled some little emendation next to it and then crossed it
out. So you can't, directly, countermand orders. I think there's some
historical precedent for this. In the book of Esther, if I remember
correctly, King ahasheurus, the king of Persia and Medea, could pretty
much give any command he wanted, however nuts, and it became law. But
he couldn't undo his previous commands. This sounds a little
inflexible, but it's limited inflexibility, (at least, what I'm
talking about here, I don't know about king Ahashuerus), it has a
built in time out, and it's better than mushiness. A degree of
inflexibility is necessary to teach you how to set good goals. There's
nothing like following through on something dumb to teach you to be
smart next time -- and if you followed through even when you were
dumb, and knew it that you were dumb, you can be sure you'll follow
through when you know you're smart.</p>
<p>2. the footsoldier card is the only card you carry around with
you. The officers and generals stay at home. So you can't just run
into a phone booth like superman and come out an officer or a general
whenever you feel like it. Only at home, in front of your file of
index cards.</p>
<p>3. the kinds of commands you give at these three different ranks
are really very different from each other. The subject matter, self
improvement, is more or less the same, but the scales at which they
operate are so different that it's like quantum physics vs. general
relativity. So the orders on the general card can't really
immediately contradict the orders on an officer card or a
footsoldier card because they're (functionally) about different
things. I'll give some examples in a bit.  </p>
<p>4. If you want to get technical, the orders you write on each rank
of card are orders for that role, not from that role. What you write
on one card isn't directly <i>to</i> the other card: it can't directly
countermand the other cards orders. The only way you can countermand
the orders on a given card is to erase those orders or rip up the
card, which you're not allowed to do.</p>
<p>OK, what do these cards look like? I was going to make this the
crux of this segment and now I'm almost out of time again. I'm going
to scan and post images of some of my cards on the everydaysystems.com
website because I think that will be more helpful than anything I
could say here, but I'll quickly talk through some of the salient
features.</p>
<p>I use lined index cards. Yellow for daily footsoldiers, red for
monthly officers, purple for the yearly generals. The orders go on the
lined side, one per line (more or less). The front of the card, the
lined side, is binding, you have to do this stuff, you can't erase
it. On the unlined back of the card, I can write free form stuff,
notes which I don't have to obey, but don't want to forget. Following
the punch card analogy, it's like a computer code comment. On daily
cards, I write phone numbers here, or ideas for my next podcast, or
stuff to remember to add to the next day's orders, or stuff that I
think should become an order maybe even today but I'm not clear enough
yet how to express it.</p>
<p>At the top of each card goes the date, to the appropriate level of
granularity. Just the year for the generals, the year and the month
for the officers, year month and day for the footsoldiers.</p>
<p>On weekdays, for daily foot soldiers, I divide each card into three
columns: work, routine, and errands. Work is pretty self
explanatory. Routine is stuff that I expect to do every day, like
shovelglove. I'm big on routine, so this column is always full for
me. Errand is one-off stuff like shopping or calling a friend or
paying a bill. I've done this for about 6 months now, and I find it an
enormously helpful division. Almost every task I can think of
obviously falls into one of these columns, and it's a good way to
balance, at a glance, 3 fundamental priorities that most of us
have. You can think of the columns as roughly corresponding to people
as well. Work is your boss and coworkers. Routine is yourself. Errand
is your family and friends. If, on average, the columns have roughly
the same number of rows, you're probably achieving a good balance. If
not, you may want to take steps to see that they do.</p>
<p>The fact that lined index cards have 10 rows is helpful too. It's a
built in sanity check on your ambition: much as you may want to do
more than 10 things in each column, it's probably not very
realistic. That limited space forces you to be realistic and make
considered, deliberate trade offs that you choose, rather than just
waking up to the fact that life imposed certain tradeoffs on you after
a while.</p>
<p>On weekends, and for the monthly and yearly cards, I don't bother
breaking it up into columns. I just do a single column list.</p>
<p>I carry each daily card around with me in my wallet. The rest I
keep in an index card filing box at home, in chronological order. I
use golf pencils, those little stubby pencils, to write on my
cards. Golf pencils are fantastic. They're small enough to fit in your
wallet. And they're cheap, you can buy a box of a few hundred for a
few bucks. I'm always losing pens and pencils but golf pencils are so
cheap and plentiful that who cares. And unlike pens, you can always
see if the darn thing is going to write. I can't stand starting to
write with a pen and then seeing it's out of ink. And with pencils you
can write at weird angles, etc.</p>
<p>As I mentioned last time, I have about half a year of experience
doing these daily punch cards, but I've only just started doing the
yearly and monthly. I'll just give a quick example of what those look
like, and report back in a few months (and years) when I have better
empirical data.</p>
<p>A monthly card corresponds to a monthly resolution that I've talked
about in previous podcasts. So, for example, try to do the no s diet
every day for a month. You might also want to attach monthly personal
Olympics medal goals to this, like no failures is gold, one failure
silver, etc. I would stick to just one card a month, to really focus
on it. That still gives you twelve a year.</p>
<p>But I'm giving myself several yearly general cards, one card per
issue. I write the year, and then the issue, like "2007 exercise," or
"2007 driving" on the top (I grew up in Manhattan, I'm a terrible
driver). Identifying these issues is actually the most important step,
for the yearly cards. Then every month you can look at these and think
how to translate it into a resolution. But I don't just identify the
issues. I also scribble potential monthly resolutions on the card, for
future reference, so I don't forget. And I even write some concrete
goals, some of them framed as personal Olympics goals with the medal
points. For example, under excerise 2007, I wrote pushups on one line,
with medal points at 60, 65, and 70. On my "driving 2007" card I have
a list of places I want to drive to as goals. I'll cross each one off
as I get there. As with the daily and monthly cards, stuff I write on
the line front of the card is binding, stuff I write on the back is
just comments. You don't have to come up with all your yearly cards on
january 1st. You can add throughout the year. But add carefully,
unless you want to stare at a lot of unacted on cards for a whole
year.</p>
<p>I could go on and on about this, but I'm out of time for today. If
you're interested, check the everydaysystems.com site, I'll be posting
scanned images of my cards and updates there. Thanks for
listening.</p>
