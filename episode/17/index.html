<p>Hi, this is Reinhard from everydaysystems.com. For the past few
weeks, I've been talking about how important it is to think in terms
of on behavior rather than results, and that it's better to stay
focused shorter periods of time in terms of tracking and planing, like
one day for the habit traffic light, and one month in terms of
resolutions. Today I'm going to talk about a way you can superimpose a
longer term and possibly even results oriented goal framework onto
these. It's called Personal Olympics. I'll explain what it is first,
and then go into why you might want to do this, despite the fact that
it seems to contradict what I've previously said on the subject.</p>
<p>The idea is that if 3 classes of Olympic medals can spur on
athletes to almost superhuman achievements, maybe a similar tiered
incentive scheme can be applied to mundaner stuff -- like your
exercise routine, or losing weight. There are no actual medals
involved, just different levels of patting oneself on the back. The
psychology behind it is sort of like the little stars they give kids
in elementary school. Those little worthless but highly motivating
stickers. The idea is that somewhere, deep down inside, despite
knowing better, we still respond to that kind of thing. The world
class Olympic connotations take something we might think of as very
personal and pathetic and make it seem worth our attention. Yes, it's
a trifle absurd, and I'm not sure this will work without a bit of a
sense of humor, but you know, you really should be taking these
personal problems seriously, and if putting them on a world stage is
what it takes, that's less absurd than just being quietly defeated by
them. And absurd is fun. Which is something most of us could use a
little more of in our personal improvement struggles. </p>
<p>It works like this: say you want to be able to do a certain number
of pushups. You come up with three, preferably evenly spaced numbers,
say 20, 25, 30. The lowest should be a little more than you can
currently do, but not too much. It should stretch you a bit, but still
be realistic. Realistic is the priority, for the bronze. Next you come
up with a time frame. Say, sometime this year. If you can hit your
lowest number, you've got the bronze. If the middle, silver, the
highest, gold.</p>
<p>These medals are all just imaginary, but you'd be surprised at how
motivating even an imaginary medal can be. Besides all that gold
star stuff I talked about before, you have the carrot of an attainable
goal always in front of you, a great distant goal to appeal to the
high stakes achiever in you, and plenty of legitimate opportunity for
self congratulation when you hit a tier.</p>
<p>What have I been using Personal Olympics for? Well, three things I'll admit to
here.</p>
<ol>
<li>pushups, aka degraded beast, for shovelglove fans. I starting
doing them as part of my shovelglove 14 minutes a few months ago, and
I want to be able to bang out a lot quickly. So I decided for 2006, my
bronze/silver/gold goals will be sets of 40/45/50 reps. I've already
blown past this, with over 55 pushups. Which I guess puts me at
platinum. If I get 60, I'll enter rock star mode, with double
platinum, etc.</li>
<li>2006 savings.  We want a bigger nest egg for when
the time comes to move, and bronze/silver/gold gives me a way to
quantify "as much as possible" in a somewhat realistic and motivating
way. I bronzed last month.</li>
<li>Hebrew language flash cards. I have a deck of Hebrew vocabulary
cards that I alter every month, and then go through as many times as
possible. 3 times is bronze, 4 is silver, 5 is gold. I've bronzed just
about every month, and silvered once. </li>
</ol>
<p>Coming up with good medal points is perhaps the trickiest part. It
helps to do some experimenting before setting them. I knew that I
could do 3 decks of cards in a month for example. And I did a few
weeks of non-Olympic pushups before coming up with those
numbers. Think of it this way: a real Olympic athlete would never go
into an Olympics without some training, why should you? In the monthly
resolution segment I talked about how bad people are at coming up with
goals, how unrealistic those goals tend to be, especially at large
time scales. Keep this in mind. Make your bronze something you're very
confident you can do. In the case of weight loss, maintenance might be
a good bronze. Most people don't even maintain, but get heavier every
year, so unambitious as this sounds, it's actually meaningful and
important.</p>
<p>So how do I square personal Olympics with the habit traffic light
and it's focus on behavior, and monthly resolution, with it's smaller
time scales?</p>
<p>Well, if I do personal Olympics, I try to do in in parallel with a
more behavior oriented, finer granularity structure. So it's not an
either/or. And personal Olympics is never the primary structure. The
fine grain behavioral stuff always takes priority. So for example, my
pushups goals are not even close to my most important fitness
structure, which is shovelglove 14 minutes every weekday plus urban
ranger. I do the personal Olympics event in addition to that
stuff. Same thing with the Hebrew cards. My primary structure for
doing those is that I have to do some every week day -- habit traffic
light.</p>
<p>What personal Olympics can give you in addition to these primary
structures is a extra motivational boost. It gives you the feeling
that you're not just going through the motions, that you're actually
getting somewhere with your behavior. </p>
<p>And if you want to, you can combine personal Olympics, monthly
resolution, and the habit traffic light, by setting the time scale for
your event to a month, and expressing your tiered goals as levels of
traffic light compliance. For example, lets say you're starting out
with the no s diet. You could say, I'm going to make a monthly
resolution for January to do the no s diet and record daily
success/exemption/failure with the habit traffic light. If I get no
failures at all in the month of January, I get a gold. One failure,
silver, Two failures, bronze. Or something like that. You could also
add something about non-weekend S days if you thought that was an
issue. Like, every non-weekend s day beyond 2 or 3 counts as a failure
for the purposes of this Olympic event. This could be particularly
useful around the holidays, when we want to be really careful to limit
celebratory eating to just the holidays themselves.</p>
<p>That's all for now. Thanks for listening.</p>
