<p>Hi, this is Reinhard from everydaysystems.com. Today I'm going to
talk about "Extreme moderation." It's an oxymoron. It's not even a
particularly original oxymoron. I found over 13000 google hits for the
term, in quotes. And yet I think it's a useful oxymoron. It can jolt
you into good behavior.</p>
<p>A little while ago I read something in the new york times in
defense of political moderation. The author took that famous Barry
Goldwater quite, "extremism in defense of liberty is no vice" and
changed it to "extremism in defense of moderation is no vice." In
other -- less eloquent -- words, political moderates should take their
moderate stance as seriously as extremists take theirs. Moderates
should pursue their moderate aims with extremist enthusiasm.  That's
sort of what I'm talking about with "extreme moderation," except
applied to personal behavior instead of politics, and taking not just
the enthusiasm of extremists, but also some of their specific
techniques.</p>
<p>Moderation isn't mushy. Or at least, it shouldn't be. It shouldn't
be just the absence of taking a stand. And yet for too many
self-professed moderates, both political and personal, I'm afraid
that's just what it is. The most powerful extremist technique is
drawing hard clear lines and exploding when those lines come anywhere
close to being crossed. Moderates should be the same way -- except we
draw those lines in different places.</p>
<p>Here's an example. Abstinence is a common extreme self help
technique: the categorical and complete exclusion of some substance,
like alcohol or added sugar. I'd just like to say in passing that
there are cases where extremism of this kind makes sense, and I don't
want to make people who need to absolutely refrain from alcohol or
tobacco or whatever feel inadequate here. On the contrary, I'm looking
at why this technique is so powerful and seeing if we can apply
aspects of it to more moderate behavior so the rest of us can learn
something from your success.</p>
<p>OK, abstinence. On one level it works because there's something
chemical going on that you're avoiding, a trigger. But on another
level, and this is the level we moderates can emulate, it works simply
because it's so damn clear. The line between 0 and 1, between
something and nothing, is very unambiguous. There is no slippery
slope. It's a line in the sand. You can cross this line, if you
decide, but you can't do it by accident or by imperceptible
degree. You're on one side or the other. That's powerful. Without
clear lines like this, the number of complex decisions you have to
make soon becomes overwhelming. In the book mindful eating, the author
did a study that showed the average American makes over 200 food
related decisions every day -- when to eat, what to eat, how much to
eat. Without clear lines in the sand to help you make quick, snap
decisions, you might make the first 2 very well because you're taking
a million factors into account, but the next 198 will ride right over
you because you simply don't have sufficient attention left over to
deal with them at all.</p>
<p>But abstinence has costs. You have to completely sacrifice what
most people regard as a great pleasure -- what you presumably regard
as a great pleasure, or you wouldn't have such a problem with it. It's
a cost some people are willing to pay, or willing to try to pay, for
the benefit of this powerful and effective clarity. But it's a high
cost. Too high for many people. They try it and feel deprived and
resentful and long for the forbidden whatever. And when they cross
over then from 0 to 1, from nothing to something, because they miss it
so much, then suddenly they've lost all all the benefits of
abstinence, it becomes a liability, it has nothing further to say to
them at this point, they've failed, and they might as well crank it up
from 1 to 11, from something to everything, because all failures, big
and small, are the same, because 1 = 11 in the system of
abstinence. So you might as well max it out, not only do you get more
pleasure but you get more drama. People can understand failing for the
sake of an 11. It's like going to war for Helen of Troy. Failure for a
1, well, that seems paltry, sort of pathetic. So abstinence demands too
much from most people, and when they inevitably fail to meet those
demands, it magnifies that failure.</p>
<p>It would be great if we could get the clarity of cold turkey
abstinence without the sweeping deprivation. And we can. Very
simply. Just draw your clear line in a different, more moderate
place. At 2 instead of 0 (like I do with glass ceiling, for the number
of glasses of alcolol I'm allowed to drink). Or at "S-days" instead of
"never," as I do with the No-s diet and shovelglove. The key is to be
just as firm about your number as the abstainer is about his, to be
just as clear about what that number is, so there are no last minute
revisions, and just as irate when you come anywhere near to crossing
it. </p>
<p>Simple doesn't mean easy. It's one thing to say "this is my
boundary" and another thing to respect that boundary. The 0 to 1
boundary compels a kind of natural respect. For other, more moderate
boundaries, you need something extra, a metaphor, a back story, a
mythology, almost. Or a joke, or a bit of poetic consonance. Something
that will jump into your mind whenever you approach that boundary and
can't immediately be reworked into something else. The letter S for
the no s diet. 14 minutes of schedualistically insignificant time for
shovelglove. The Song of the urban ranger. </p>
<p>You might object that naturally moderate people do not follow
explicit rules, that they are moderate out of instinct or something,
or, on the other end of the spectrum, that they simply somehow make
rational decisions about stuff that the rest of us can't bring
ourselves to be rational about. People in France, for instance, who
are held up as exemplars of moderate eating, do not have a written
code that makes them eat the way they do. But I would argue that they
do have rules, they do have a code, but it's an internal, largely
unconscious code of habit. It was instilled in them by custom, by
tradition, which is sort of like the habit of a whole society. It
might be unconscious, but it is still a rule. It's not like the French
are rational Mr. Spocks logically evaluating every culinary decision
for maximum long term health benefit. And it's not like they simply
"eat when they are hungry" out of some primal instinct. Nothing could
be more American than "eat when you are hungry."</p>
<p>It's still rules that govern French eating behavior, rules that are
built into the fabric of society itself. If you don't believe this, go
to France. Go to a french restaurant or have dinner in a french
home. If you're an American, you'll immediately be impressed by the
ritual involved. You'll also probably be impressed by a sense of
inadequacy at your not getting these rules and rituals, but that's
another story.</p>
<p>Those of us who don't live in such a society, -- and from what I
understand, such societies aren't what they used to be, there are more
McDonald's per capita in Paris than anywhere else in the world, I
think, and french women are getting fatter all the time -- those of us
who don't live in such a society have no choice but to resort to
explicit rules. And if we're smart, we'll make those explicit rules
moderate, like the traditional social structures they are standing in
for.</p>
<p>I'll close on another quote from the world of politics. Teddy
Roosevelt had this great piece of advice, "Speak softly and carry a
big stick." That's exactly what we aspiring behavioral moderates
should do. Don't insist on much, but insist on it like hell. Not with
big flamboyant gestures, but with actions. Oh, and carry a big carrot
too.</p>
<p>That's all for today. Thanks for listening.</p>
