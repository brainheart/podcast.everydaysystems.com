<p>Hi, I'm Reinhard. I run a self improvement site call
everydaysystems.com.</p>
<p>Five years ago, I had all the usual self improvement problems. I
was fat. I smoked too much. I drank too much. I exercised too
little. And I diddled away all my free time in front of the
computer. Low self esteem, that problem I guess I didn't really have,
beyond what can be expected of a fat, slothful, drunk who wastes all
his free time.</p>
<p>So I came up with a bunch of simple, common sense self improvement
systems to fix these problems. And they worked. I solved my
problems. So I put the systems up on the web. I thought they'd be
interesting just as a personal record, what I did, what one guy
did. But people took these idiosyncratic, personal, and, admittedly,
kind of crazy sounding systems and applied them to their own problems
-- successfully. Even more successfully that I had, in some cases,
because their problems had been bigger to start with.</p>
<p>Just a little disclaimer before I continue: I am not health
professional of any kind. I'm a computer programmer with degrees in
English literature and library science. Please be skeptical about
whatever I tell you and consult your doctor if you have any doubts. If
you do not have any doubts, ask you doctor whether maybe you
should. Do not sue me. Legally speaking, this is entertainment, got
it?</p>
<p>OK, so why didn't I just use some existing off the shelf self
improvement system instead of rolling my own? There are a ton of
commercial self help systems for diet and exercise and everything
else, why didn't I just use one of them? In computer programming, you
always want to see if there's a preexisting solution to your problem
before reinventing the wheel. That's a cardinal no-no. You don't want
to waste time working on solved problems.</p>
<p>The problem with commercial self help systems is that they made me
feel like a sucker. Maybe some of these gurus are honest, but they all
seem like such charlatans. Besides their cheesy affect they all want
to sell you these branded diet bars and what not. That was my first
problem. I just didn't trust them.</p>
<p>The other problem was that despite the too good to be true tone
all these gurus have, when you cut through all the mumbo jumbo, and
there's a lot of mumbo jumbo, the plans are actually really
unpleasant. You either have to spend all your time counting stuff --
carbs, calories. Or you have to give up whole categories of food. I
like food, all different kinds of food, that's why I was fat.</p>
<p>Or, on the exercise front, you had to do mind numbingly boring,
uncomfortable but supposedly really effective exercises
--physiologically speaking. </p>
<p>Maybe some this stuff could have worked if I could have forced
myself to do it, I'm not disputing that, I'm not even interested in
that, but I knew I wouldn't be able to make myself do it, because it
was too unpleasant. Maybe for a month, I could stick it out, maybe
even for a year. But no way for a lifetime. And that's what you want,
right? You don't want to go back to being fat after a year.  If you
can't see yourself doing a diet or an exercise program for the rest of
your life, why bother starting? It's a waste of time and will. And
physically bad for you too -- yoyo dieting is supposed to be terrible,
right?</p>
<p>Look, If it really seemed like one of these systems was working for
lots of people, maybe I'd have gotten over my reservations and gone
with one of them . But the statistics didn't seem that way. A huge
percentage of americans claimed to be doing low carb at the time. If
low carb really worked and this huge percentage of the country was
doing it, why were we still getting fatter? Why were we much fatter
than we or any society had ever been in history? I know there are true
believers who say, well, if you do it right and stick with it, it'll
work. But if almost no one managers to do it right or stick with it,
why should I be any different? It's like communism. People say "well,
Stalin, Mao, and pol pot didn't get it quite right, let's give it
another try." That's crazy.</p>
<p>So the off the shelf solutions weren't attractive. How would I do
it differently? To tell you the truth, I came up with the systems
first, and then thought up </p>
<p>The systems focus on the internal not external. That means not on
the physical properties of certain foods or exercise movements but on
the much harder problem of how to get myself to behave
differently. That means three main things. The systems need to be
painless enough so that I won't hate doing them, natural feeling
enough so that I can automate them into unconsious habit, "second
nature," and unobtrusive, timewise, so I'm not tempted to give them up
as soon as I get busy.</p>
<p>The systems should also be free or cheap, simple but specific, and
grounded by some striking image, pun or metaphor to give them a sort
of superrational compellingness. They should be fun. Funny even. That
way I don't feel like a dismal slave following them, I feel like a
good sport, holding up my end of a joke.</p>
<p>So what are the systems? I'll give a really quick overview now, and
then revisit each one in it's own future podcast.</p>
<p>We'll, there 800 pounds gorrilla (literally, almost) of self
improvement issues: the problem of being overweight. Or more
specifically (because remember, we have to break each problem down
into tractable component parts), the problem of eating too much (lack
of exercise is another problem I'll deal with separately, as is (and
this may be shocking to some) nutrition). We used to have a great word
for this: gluttony. Can't use that word now that everybody is fat,
right?  Though you have to wonder: if this is the terminology people
used when everyone was skinny, maybe there's something to it.. In any
case, The solution, the everyday system that solves this problem is
called the No S Diet (or you can pronounce it the noes-diet, not nose
on your face, but plural of the word no). The NO S Diet: No Snacks, NO
sweets, no seconds except (sometimes) on days that start with
S. That's actually the whole system right there. 14 words. The worlds
shortest effective diet plan. You wouldn't take diet advice from a fat
person, why take it from a fat book, right? And No S is
effective. "Don't eat too much" is shorter, just 4 words, but it isn't
effective. I lost over 40 pounds on No-s and kept it off for almost 5
years now. No yoyoing. Other people on the no s diet bulletin board
have lost even more weight than this.  I do have a few more words than
these 14 to say about No-s, but I'll save that for a future podcast. If
you're antsy to learn more now, go to nosdiet.com. Or
everydaysystems.com. You can get more information about all these
systems from everydaysystems.com</p>
<p>Another big problem is lack of exercise (or as we used to say when
we weren't so given to it, Sloth). It's such a big problem that I've
got two systems for dealing with it. Urban Ranger: an inspirational
metaphor, a kind of role playing almost, to get you walking,
purposefully waling. "Purposeful" is the key here.  And shovelglove, a
workout that involves wrapping an old sweater around a sledgehammer
and mimicking the movements of traditional farmers, coal miners, and
other manual laborers for 14 minutes every weekday (and yes, 14 is a
significant number). So shoveling movements. Tree choping
movements. Butter churning movements. Fencepost driving movements. And
more. The rationale behind shovelglove is that by doing movements that
mimic real life activities, you, for one, exercise muscles that you
might actually want to use in real life. It's not just cosmetic. God
forbid you actually have to shovel snow or something. Shovelglove
prepares you for this. But also, more importantly, these movements are
fun. There are movements we've done (more or less) for thousands of
years and our bodies like doing them. It's a kind of communion with
our laboring ancestors. And it's fun. It's play. You're pretending. It
gives your imagination something to work with. It's not trapped in
this totally uninspired, totally brainless physical prison of an
activity.  It may be less physiologically efficient than some
contrived gym movement in terms of working some particular muscle, but
because you can get into the workout, you stand a much better chance
of actually doing it. And the fact that you enjoy it is worth
something in itself, I think. You do it, you like doing it. You like
doing it, so you do it.
</p>
<p>Another problem is alcohol. I'm not going to say alcoholism, that's
more than an everyday problem, please look somewhere else for a
solution for that, I don't want to be the slightest bit responsible
for advising you on a problem of that magnitude. I'm talking about
occasional binge drinking. If you have this problem, most of the time
you're fine, but every now and then, you find yourself smashed. And in
deep, humiliating trouble. Perhaps national news worthy trouble. This
is actually a pretty topical issue at the moment I guess. Moderate
drinking, on the other hand, is supposed to be ridiculously good for
you, and, incidentally, a great pleasure. How does a non-alcoholic who
is nevertheless given to occasional disastrous binges navigate this?
How do you get your resveratrol and <i>joie de vivre</i> and what not with
reasonable assurance that you're not going to wind up puking your guts
out in the back of a patrol car? Easy. Glass ceiling. A two drink a
day absolute maximum. No more than too glasses a day. That's your
ceiling. Yes, there's fudge room. But not enough fudge room to find
yourself insulting female police officers or indulging paranoid anti
Semitic fantasies.</p>
<p>Last problem I'm going to mention today is distraction
management. We aimlessly surf the web or listen to all kinds of crazy
podcasts when we should be doing something else. Then we complain that
we don't have time to do what we really want to do. This is a much
more difficult problem to deal with than it seems, but I chip away at
it with a system called Weekend Luddite. The original luddites were
textile workers who smashed machines that were putting them out of
work in I think it was 19th century England. Weekend luddites are more
moderate. We don't smash machines, we just avoid them. And only on
weekends. And only machines that we find are wasting our time. And
there are a few other little exemptions that I'll get to when I give
weekend luddite it's own segment. Distraction management is actually a
serious problem. It doesn't seem that way. It seems almost
innocuous. Web surfing. Video games. Watching infomercials on channel
357. Good harmless fun. But it's really not. Wasting time is wasting
life. What's more valuable? I'm all for relaxing. But there are much
better, more intentional ways to relax.</p>
<p>If these systems seem too simple to work, there are two reasons for
that. One, ok, you probably really do need to hear a little more about
them. And you shall. I'll give each one a segment of its own in future
podcasts. Or go to everydaysystems.com. The other reason they sound so
simple is well, they really are very simple. But that's an
advantage. Complexity is bad, where it isn't absolutely necessary. And
it isn't for these problems.</p>
<p>There are also some common subsystems that some of these systems
share that might be useful to you in creating your own systems. I'll
cover these as well in a future podcast.</p>
<p>I hope I've at least piqued your interest to hear more. That's it
for this week. Thanks for listening.  </p>
