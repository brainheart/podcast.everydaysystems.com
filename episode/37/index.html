<p>Hi this is Reinhard from EverydaySystems.com
</p>
<p>Today  -- at long last -- I'm going to wrap up the mods &amp; tweaks trilogy.
</p>
<p>I'm going to talk about what to do when a mere mod isn't enough: How to roll your own everyday system from scratch.
</p>
<p>Or more accurately, not from scratch, but stitched together from certain reusuable core components and design patterns,
</p>
<p> to use some software engineering terminology, and in particular one core idea, that I'm going to focus on today.
</p>
<p>In a way, today's topic of everyday Everyday Systems Design is a bigger subject than that of the whole mods and tweaks trilogy.
</p>
<p>So big, in fact, that I'm probably not going to be able to do much more than introduce it.
</p>
<p>And I'm kind of sneaking it in by making it part of the trilogy here.
</p>
<p>Because wanting to create a new system isn't necessarily step three of a mod attempt.
</p>
<p>You might be in the market for a new system, not because one of my "out of the box" systems didn't quite do it for you, 
</p>
<p>but because you're trying to solve a completely different problem, one that I haven't even attempted to solve.
</p>
<p>I only have systems for stuff that I personally had a problem with. 
</p>
<p>Maybe you're an obsessive social networker. Maybe you have trouble sleeping regular hours. 
</p>
<p>Maybe you have trouble keeping your credit card debt under control.
</p>
<p>I never had a much of a problem with these, so I don't have systems for them.
</p>
<p>But I think they'll all good potential targets for systems.
</p>
<p>But what do I mean by systems? What is an everyday system? 
</p>
<p>What do the No S Diet, and Shovelglove, and Chain of Self-Command, the personal punch cards, etc. all have in common?
</p>
<p>And on the surface, it may not seem like not whole lot.
</p>
<p>One involves cutesy rules, the other one a sledgehammer, the other a pack of (prefereably yellow) index cards.
</p>
<p>But it turns out, if you look more closely, that they do have a lot of things in common.
</p>
<p>So many, in fact, that I'm not going to have time to go into them all today.
</p>
<p>Today I'm only going to have time to go into one. And even that only barely.
</p>
<p>Because it's the biggest.
</p>
<p>It's the core idea behind all the everyday systems: I call it Systematic Moderation
</p>
<p>Now, to be fair, I didn't come up with this term until years after I'd thought of most of the individual systems.
</p>
<p>But I do think the idea behind the term was there from the beginning.
</p>
<p>People now think of me as this tremendously organized and together person.
</p>
<p>My office mate talks about "Reinhard level discipline"
</p>
<p>But I was emphatically not like this back in late 2001 when the first everyday system, the no s diet occurred to me.
</p>
<p>I was kind of a mess. Not a total disaster. Not rock bottom and all that.
</p>
<p>But someone who was constantly making grand resolutions I didn't keep, starting projects I didn't finish, 
</p>
<p>indulging behaviors I didn't feel good about.
</p>
<p>But something clicked with no-s, when I came up with that system. 
</p>
<p>I got something profoundly right, that was deeper than just the no-s rules, as helpful as they in themselves were.
</p>
<p>Because not just did I lose a bunch of weight, and learn to enjoy eating again, diet specific stuff, 
</p>
<p>but I started coming up with system after system. Knocking off my problems one by one.
</p>
<p>And I'm convinced that the thing that clicked, and turned me into this systems factory, 
</p>
<p>is this idea that I've only recently found a good label for: systematic moderation 
</p>
<p>And I've also come up with sort of a subtitle for this label. 
</p>
<p>Two subtitles actually, but I'll save the second one for a future episode.
</p>
<p>Sytematic Moderation: for sustainable good habits.
</p>
<p>You may remember that I previously did a podcast episode on "Extreme Moderatation".
</p>
<p>Systematic Moderation sounds similar, and it is similar.
</p>
<p>And you can see how I was onto this idea even back then, in January 2007. 
</p>
<p>And not just onto it, but using very similar terminology.
</p>
<p>"Extreme Moderation" was a great term for an initial jolt, as a rhetorical tool.
</p>
<p>But as a general purpose label, I think "Systematic Moderation" is better.
</p>
<p>For one thing, "Extreme Moderation" is an oxymoron, a paradox.
</p>
<p>And paradox can be powerful, but it's like cayenne petter, you want to use it sparingly.
</p>
<p>"Systematic" is a little easier on the mental digestion. And so more appropriate for everyday use, I think. 
</p>
<p>It's also a broader, encompassing term. 
</p>
<p>"Systematic moderation" can contain the connotations of extreme clarity and precision that I talked about in 
</p>
<p>the extreme moderation podcast,
</p>
<p>and it ties into the software systems metaphor that I've used before with Everyday Systems.
</p>
<p>It even just sounds more like everyday systems, right? They've both got the root word "system" in there.
</p>
<p>But more importantly, Systematic Moderation suggests the alternative approaches to self-improvement: 
</p>
<p>On the one hand, you've got UNsystematic moderation. 
</p>
<p>On the other hand, you've got systematic extremism.
</p>
<p>And I think this is important because I think it becomes very clear what I'm talking about 
</p>
<p>and why it's so useful when you look at these three approaches in conjunction.
</p>
<p>UNsystematic moderation is basicially conventional wisdom, stuff your grandma used to tell you. 
</p>
<p>"All things in moderation." "Eat not to excess, drink not to dullness."
</p>
<p>Or my favorite  "Appetite is the best sauce."
</p>
<p>Some of it is trite, but some of it is rather beautiful.
</p>
<p>The problem with it is not that it's false. It's true. Moderation is good. And by all means, let's continue to praise it.
</p>
<p>The problem with it is that it's insufficiently specific to solve concrete problems.
</p>
<p>A saying like this can sound so salt of the earth, so homey and solid, but if you think about it,
</p>
<p> it's almost ethereal, immaterial, in the way it's detatched from the practical realities of everyday life: 
</p>
<p>What precisely are you supposed to do? Here at this moment right now?
</p>
<p>It's really just a value judgement. It tells you what's good. But not how to attain that good.
</p>
<p>It's inspiring, but not instructive.
</p>
<p>The opposite approach is Systematic Extremism, which is not at all inspiring, but VERY instructive, dictatorially instructive.
</p>
<p>And I think, historically speaking, it's a reaction against unsystematic moderation.
</p>
<p>Because I think, to some extent, unsystematic moderation did use to work.
</p>
<p>Back in the 19th century and before,
</p>
<p>if you ate too much today you'd starve tomorrow, 
</p>
<p>of if you procrastinated chopping enough wood in the summer you'd freeze to death in the winter.
</p>
<p>And society provided traditional structures to buttress your resolve well before it came to that.
</p>
<p>You'd be ostracized most likely before anyone died as the result of your immoderation.
</p>
<p>Grandma didn't need to be all that precise about moderation because nature and society would give you
</p>
<p> painfully specific and immediate feedback.
</p>
<p>But today calories are cheap and convenient enough that you can stuff yourself today and tomorrow and the next day.
</p>
<p>And so on. For a long time before the results of your behavior catch up with you.
</p>
<p>The Grim Reaper, that most persuasive of motivational speakers, is no longer such an immediate presence.
</p>
<p>And tradition, is pretty much out of the picture as well.
</p>
<p>Immoderate behaviors still hurt you today, but it takes a lot longer to feel their effects. 
</p>
<p>You're not going to die tomorrow (or even be ostracized) because you were lazy or greedy today.
</p>
<p>The feedback loop is a lot longer. It's no longer self-correcting. 
</p>
<p>By the time you get the feedback, the bad result, it's, maybe not TOO late to correct the problem, 
</p>
<p>but certainly late enough that the underlying behavioral problem that caused it has gotten really bad in the meantime. 
</p>
<p>You've given your bad habits a lot of time to get deeply ingrained.
</p>
<p>So people started to get frustrated that unsystematic moderation wasn't working anymore. 
</p>
<p>And some enterprising self help gurus saw its deficiency, that it was unsystematic. 
</p>
<p>that it was mushy and imprecise. And they corrected that. They added precise rules and system.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>But they didn't see it's strength, moderation. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>They threw the baby out with the bathwater. Or the grandma out with the bathwater.
</p>
<p>There are two basic kinds of systematic extremism.
</p>
<p>One relies on an extreme of deprivation. No alcohol. Or, no fat. Or no carbs. Forbidden foods diets. 
</p>
<p>The other relies on an extreme of attention. Count grams of fat. Or calories. Or carbs. Substance accounting diets.
</p>
<p>But I think the difference between them is ultimately superficial.
</p>
<p>They both give specific rules and the rules tend to focus on stuff. Stuff that you should avoid. Or stuff you should count.
</p>
<p>And I think the problem is not so much the specificity of these rules -- specificity can actually be a very powerful thing
</p>
<p>I think the problem is what they're focusing on and the scale of what they're focusing on. Not you. Not behavior. But stuff. 
</p>
<p>Really small stuff.
</p>
<p>Unlike grandma's conventional wisdom, which was too high level, this is too low level. It's microscopic. Literally. 
</p>
<p>Calories. Carbs. Molecules. Biochemistry.
</p>
<p>Grandma's wisdom was immaterial, this is almost reductionistically materialistic.
</p>
<p>I like to think of systematic moderation as a kind of hegelian synthesis of these two opposing 
</p>
<p>but equally doomed strategies.
</p>
<p>Systematic Moderation agrees with grandma about the value of moderation, and with the extremist gurus about the value of clarity, system and precision.
</p>
<p>And it frames the problem on just the right level of granularity. 
</p>
<p>It addresses problems not on the level of high level value judgments, or on low level biochemistry, 
</p>
<p>but on the middle level of behavior and patterns of behavior. 
</p>
<p>Now all three of these levels are true in some descriptive sense. 
</p>
<p>You could accurately describe the problem of being overweight, for example, 
</p>
<p>on the level of a failure of "all things in moderation." 
</p>
<p>some moral value is out of whack
</p>
<p>or in terms of biochemistry. Too many calories are being digested, not enough are being burned, etc. 
</p>
<p>That is literally, truly what is happening. In both cases.
</p>
<p>But it's the middle layer of precise behavior that is, not only descriptively accurate, but prescriptively useful.
</p>
<p>No-s, for example gives, you a pattern of meal based eating. 
</p>
<p>It doesn't obsess about stuff, particular kinds of food. What molecules you are eating.
</p>
<p>Nor does it belabor the obvious (I hope) fact that moderation is good. 
</p>
<p>Instead it gives you a specific pattern of moderate behavior. It's very clear, but it's clear about behavior, not molecules.
</p>
<p>Here's another example.
</p>
<p>The problem is alcohol. Problem drinking.
</p>
<p>UNSystematic Moderation would be just try to drink less. No quantification. Just try not to drink so much.
</p>
<p>The Systematic Extremist position would be total abstinence.
</p>
<p>Systematic Moderation (for example, you could think of others) glass ceiling, a 2 glass a day absolute limit.
</p>
<p>Now all three of these approaches can be effective, and are for some people.
</p>
<p>I don't want to suggest that systematic moderation is the solution for all problems for everyone.
</p>
<p>Especially with alcohol systematic extremism -- total abstinence -- is often necessary.
</p>
<p>But I do think that systematic moderation could help a lot of people who are unsuccessfully struggling with one 
</p>
<p>of the other alternatives, and might not even realize that there's this third approach.
</p>
<p>The distinction between these three approaches is often kind of like you if you asked three people for 
</p>
<p>directions on how to get somewhere.
</p>
<p>Unsystematically moderate Grandma would said, "just be there. It would be good if you were there." Though she'd express it in more charmingly poetic and pithy way.
</p>
<p>And extremist Guru would say, "first send an electrical signal from your brain to your foot to make your right foot forward, 
</p>
<p>then your left foot." Etc. Except I don't know enough about physiology to go into all the detail that guru would tell you.
</p>
<p>An advocate of Systematic Moderation would be the only one to give you actual directions, that you'd recognize as directions: 
</p>
<p>Go 2 blocks. Turn left on main street at the light. Etc.  
</p>
<p>All three speak the truth. But only the last one is likely to get you where you're going.
</p>
<p>Which brings me to the second part of the formula: "for sustainable good habits." 
</p>
<p>Which is the "where you're going" part. It's a statement of what the output of your efforts is going should be.
</p>
<p>Not a results goal, but a habit. 
</p>
<p>Because you're not practicing systematic moderation to hit some finite result. 
</p>
<p>Say, lose 50 pounds. Or run a 6 minute mile. Or whatever.
</p>
<p>You may achieve these things in the process. But that's not the point.
</p>
<p>The point IS the process: 
</p>
<p>the behavioral structure you put in place that's going to stay there long after you hit these goals.
</p>
<p>Goals can be great. They're often necessary. If you have a deadline at work, that has to be a goal. 
</p>
<p>You don't have a choice in the matter.
</p>
<p>But I think in terms of self improvement goals can be dangerous.
</p>
<p>Because a goal implies "you're done."
</p>
<p>But with most self-improvement, behavioral problems, you're never done. 
</p>
<p>It's like I say in my no-s diet before and during page: 
</p>
<p>"After" is a myth. It's "before" and "during." "After" is when you're dead.
</p>
<p>Or on the shovelglove home page where I talk about "the Progress Trap."
</p>
<p>"Progress is intrinsically temporary -- maintenance is what you'll be doing for the rest of your life."
</p>
<p>You want to get out of "Goal-think" and into "habit-think"
</p>
<p>And to the extent that you can't get rid of it, and I don't think you'll ever be able to completely get rid of it,
</p>
<p>you want to use "goal-think" and redirect it to serving "habit-think"
</p>
<p>By making behavior, behavioral compliance the goal rather than some result of that compliance.
</p>
<p>For example, instead of focusing on pounds lost if you're doing no-s, or the weight of your shovelglove, 
</p>
<p>focus on days on habit, or even better, use the habitcal 
</p>
<p>"Habit-think" is powerful not just in contrast with "goal think," 
</p>
<p>but also with this false modern dichotomy that a lot of us believe in,
</p>
<p> between irresistible addition on the one had, and total freedom on the other.
</p>
<p>"Habit-think" acknowledges that there are irrational forces pushing you to make decisions.
</p>
<p>It's not naive about that.
</p>
<p>But it's not fatalistic like addiction. These forces can often, can usually be resisted. 
</p>
<p>And what's more, they can be made to work for you. 
</p>
<p>The term Addiction has this implication of always being bad and always being irresistable. 
</p>
<p>The best you can do is avoid it, avoid a trigger situation, hide.
</p>
<p>But Habit has degree and direction. There are strong habits and week habits, there are bad habits and good habits.
</p>
<p>And it also has dynamism. Habits can change.
</p>
<p>It's not only hugely inspiring, to think in terms of habit like this, in the sense that you no longer think you're doomed, 
</p>
<p>it's also just useful. It opens your eyes to these powerful tools.
</p>
<p>OK, what about SUSTAINABLE good habits?
</p>
<p>Now I know "sustainablity" is this obnoxiously trendy word at the moment.
</p>
<p>So it's with some reservations that I use it here. 
</p>
<p>But, if you're going to worry about macro political issues like environmental or energy sustainablity, 
</p>
<p>shouldn't you start by getting your own house in order? 
</p>
<p>By making sure your personal habits are personally sustainable? 
</p>
<p>That you can practice them without ruining --not the environment, or the world -- but yourself?
</p>
<p>I don't want to say these big issues aren't also big problems that demand our attention.
</p>
<p>But it seems funny to me that so many people seem to see sustainablity problems on this big societal level
</p>
<p>and not in themselves.
</p>
<p>Sustainable habits can be surprisingly hard to come up with. And the biggest reason is hubris. People are overambitious.
</p>
<p>And they're overambitious without even realizing they're being overamitious.
</p>
<p>I'll give an example.
</p>
<p>The biggest opening for this kind of hubris is time.
</p>
<p>People think, for example, I want to exercise. Or meditate. Half an hour a day. That isn't much, right? At least to start.
</p>
<p>Well, half an hour a day is actually a lot. Maybe not today, when you're making this resolution. But many days. 
</p>
<p>And remember, this is something you want to do for the rest of your life.
</p>
<p>As soon as work gets stressful, or family chaos rears it's head, half an hour becomes an unbearably burdensome commitment.
</p>
<p>And then your habit gets interrupted. You can't maintain it. It ceases to be a habit. You stop doing it.
</p>
<p>When you're considering a new behavior to add to your routine, come at it like you're allocating some permanent slice of yourself, for the rest of your life.
</p>
<p>Not just half an hour today. But half an hour every weekday.
</p>
<p>Remember, it's not a finite goal. It's not a step toward something, that's going to be done and over.
</p>
<p>It's a permanent slice of something, a slice of you, a slice of your whole life.
</p>
<p>Imagine you have your whole life lying in front of you and you're slicing out a cross section.
</p>
<p>Half an hour is huge when you look at it that way.
</p>
<p>So what you should do instead is come up with an embarrassingly small amount of time to commit to at first.
</p>
<p>That's unobtrusive enough that you can stick to it even when things get rough.
</p>
<p>I'm fond of 14 minutes, but it might be better to start even smaller. Start with 5 minutes. Or 7 minutes.
</p>
<p>If you can actually comply with this tiny amount of time for a solid month, then maybe permit yourself to go from 5 to 10, or from 7 to 14 or whatever. 
</p>
<p>The extra time is a reward from your sober moderate self to your ambitious, enthusiastic self.
</p>
<p>You want throttle your hubris, not let it run away with you.
</p>
<p>That's the hardest part about self-disclipline. Not doing more, but doing less. Pacing yourself. 
</p>
<p>Holding yourself back so you can keep on going for the rest of your life.
</p>
<p>Stretching that enthusiasm out over years and decades instead of letting it immediately exhaust itself.
</p>
<p>And I'd never go much beyond 14 minutes for any daily or N-daily routine. Maybe 20, tops. Because think about it: you might get much better at 
</p>
<p>meditating, or French, or exercising as you practice whatever it is you're doing, but that doesn't mean you're all of a sudden going 
</p>
<p>to have more time to do it in.
</p>
<p>It sounds ridiculously obvious when I state it like this, but I'm amazed when I talk to people about their self improvement projects 
</p>
<p>at how often they fall into this "I'll have more time as I get better" fallacy.
</p>
<p>So practice living with that time commitment now, up front. 
</p>
<p>Progress is going to be about making that time denser, not longer. 
</p>
<p>And I wouldn't systematically explicitly about making it denser. Just worry about making it happen at all. 
</p>
<p>Carve out the time, consistently, provide the external frame for your behavior to happen in, and the frame will get filled in. 
</p>
<p>Focus on the letter of the law and the spirit will come.
</p>
<p>Now please don't feel discouraged if you're one of those people who's inclined to be overambitious
</p>
<p>Don't think you have to make do with an attainable but uninspiring vision of what you can become, 
</p>
<p>That you're settling for mediocrity by being moderate.
</p>
<p>Because the goods news is, and this is something I've been really amazed to experience,
</p>
<p> is how much of a difference even very short blocks of time and small amounts of effort can make if you're 
</p>
<p>consistent about complying with what you set out to do. 
</p>
<p>14 minutes of exercise every N-day can transform you. 
</p>
<p>For example.
</p>
<p>It really doesn't take much. It just takes consistency.
</p>
<p>OK, so that's the core idea, Systematic Moderation, and the theory behind it.
</p>
<p>I think if you keep that idea in mind and nothing else, you'll be a fair way to coming up with your own systems.
</p>
<p>I have a lot more specific components and design patterns that extend this core idea of systematic moderation, 
</p>
<p>but in the interest of avoiding podcast hubris and getting this episode (and this trilogy) done, 
</p>
<p>I'm going to have to save those for future episodes.
</p>
<p>Thanks for listening.
