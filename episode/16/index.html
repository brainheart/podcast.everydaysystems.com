<p>Hi, this is Reinhard from everydaysystems.com. Last week I talked a
bit about why new years resolutions aren't a good idea. Today, I'm
going to talk about what you should replace them with: monthly
resolutions.</p>
<p>First off, why make resolutions at all, at any scale? Well, I think
the most important reason is clarity. When you make a resolution, it's
a decisive, solemn event. The next day you don't think, "so am I
really doing this?" You know your are -- or at least, that you're
supposed to. That's very important. Because the hardest part about
following any self improvement system is resisting all those excuses
you're going to concoct. And the best excuse goes like this:
"Consciousness of failure is painful. But I can't fail if I'm not even
trying, so let me see if I can somehow convince myself that I'm not
really trying."  Clarity is the only defense against this, and a
resolution gives you that clarity. Another benefit of making a
resolution is that initial rush of willpower that you get. It's like
starting the ignition switch in your car.</p>
<p>So what's wrong with making resolutions on a yearly scale? A bunch
of things.</p>
<ol>
<li>It's hard to plan realistically at that large a scale. It's
possible, but you'd have to spend a lot more time thinking about it
than I imagine most people do. Most people don't think seriously about
their resolutions until after they've had a few drinks and they're
watching that ball about to drop.</li>
<li>not only are you more likely to make planning mistakes, to plan
badly, but it's harder to recover from these mistakes. When you screw
up, the temptation will be to wait till next new years resolution to
recover, because that's when you get your clean slate again. There's
no built in structure for failure recovery in a reasonable amount of
time. And so your motivational structure -- new years resolutions --
actually becomes an excuse for procrastination, it becomes anti
motivational.</li>
<li>A year doesn't map well to the number of problems we have. how
many resolutions do you make a year?  How many problems do you have
that you'd like to solve? You probably have a lot of problems. And if
you try to take account of this great multiplicity of problems and
make lots of new year's resolutions each year to address them, you're
likely to lose focus. If you make just one a year, well, that's not a
lot of problem solving going on, even if you do succeed (which is
unlikely). It would have taken me centuries to achieve minimal life
competence if I'd stuck to just one resolution a year.</li>
</ol>
<p>Making monthly resolutions gives you the clarity and motivation
benefits of yearly resolutions, without all these disadvantages. A
month is a much easier scale at which to realistically plan. And if
you screw up, you don't have to wait a whole year to get your clean
slate and recover and reset, you just have to wait till the end of the
month. And you can focus on just one problem at a time and still
(theoretically) solve 12 problems a year. </p>
<p>A month is also long enough (over 21 days, right?) for some
serious habituation to occur, even with a slip up or two. It works
great in conjunction with the habit traffic light I talked about in
previous podcasts, because a month is a page in a calendar. Marking
off success/exempt/and failure days in green/yellow/red gives you a
striking and motivating picture of how you're doing for the month. And
it's especially perfect for the Christmas season -- it's like an
advent calendar. Except instead of a little piece of chocolate every
day, you get a little piece of the consciousness of virtue.</p>
<p>I limit myself to just one resolution a month, because I don't want
to pile on more new behaviors than I can handle, and I don't have to
worry about not getting around to my other problems because I know
I've got 11 more slots for the year. Every month I ask myself "what's
my one new resolution for this month?" Some stick, some don't, but
it's no huge loss if they don't because next month I get another
shot. So another benefit is that it lowers the risks for self
experimentation. If I get several great ideas for new habits, I choose
one, and reserve the rest for future months (and it's amazing how
ungreat they often seem by then).</p>
<p>I read a funny statistic that the average new years resolution
barely lasts one month anyway. So in a way, you've always been making
monthly resolutions on new years, you just didn't know it. Work with
this reality of human nature instead of against it, and you'll get
much more done.</p>
<p>That's all for today. Thanks for listening.</p>
