<html><head></head><body><p>Hi, this is Reinhard from everyday systems.com. Last episode I
started talking about a system I call audiodidact: using sound
recordings to teach yourself stuff. As I mentioned, It has two
components: input, which I covered last time, and output, which I'll
talk about today.</p>
<p>On one level, Audiodidact output is what it sounds like: you talk
into a voice recorder. How is this didactic? Well, it's as deeply auto
didactic as you can get. By talking, you learn about yourself. The
Socratic injunction to know thyself.</p>
<p>I do audiodidact output on several time scales. The most basic
scale is seconds, a few seconds at a time. I carry around a recorder
with me an mumble into it for a few seconds whenever I get a bright
idea or want to blow off steam. Until recently, people would have
thought I was crazy walking down the street talking to myself, but now
with cell phones it seems perfectly normal. I also do audiodidact
output on the scale of minutes, 7 minutes, to be precise, which I'll
describe at the end of this podcast.</p>
<p>Once a week or so, I listen to the week's recordings and transcribe
them. The transcription is a tad time consuming, but it's not too bad,
once you get a sense as to how loquacious you should be, and it's
fantastic for your typing skills. Beats the pants off of mavis
beacon. And it forces you to review what you said, at least
once. Which is good in terms of this being a meaningful exercise in
self knowledge.</p>
<p>I used to do audiodidact with an analog micro cassette recorder,
but for the last year and a half I've been using an Olympus DS-2
digital recorder, which is fantastic. It's as simple to use as an
analog recorder, gives much better sound quality (it's what I use for
these podcasts), and it produces digital files which you can easily
back up or muck with on the computer -- you transfer the files with a
USB cable. The only downside is that it produces WMA files instead of
mp3, but they're easy enough to convert.</p>
<p>What are the kinds of things I speak into the recorder when I'm
recording just a few seconds at a time? 1. Todos, tasks 2. creative
ideas for work, my websites, self-improvement projects, podcasts,
whatever 3. words of anger or exasperation which it's good to give
vent to but perhaps not to the person who inspired them. I call this
auto therapy, and 4. just sort of diary entries. I'll say a few words
about each of these.</p>
<p>1. Todos. Ordinary todos are probably more efficiently dealt with
on pencil and paper -- or punch card -- , but audio nagging is great
for stubborn stuff that you just don't want to do. It's embarrassing
to listen to yourself repeat the same todo for weeks on end. I have
nagged myself into taking care of things I never could have brought
myself to do otherwise.</p>
<p>Audio todos are also great when you're not really sure what it is
you want to do. You have a general idea, but it's still a little
murky. By talking it through, by making slightly off resolutions for a
few days, you get a better sense of the problem. You wind up with a
more doable todo.</p>
<p>2. creative ideas. As I mentioned in the urban ranger podcast, you
think better when you walk. But it's awkward to write while
walking. Talking into a recorder, on the other hand, is the most
natural thing in the world. Urban ranger and audiodidact are very
closely intertwined for me.</p>
<p>3. Autotherapy. Talking into a recorder is a great way to blow off
steam without injuring or offending anyone. Most people know me as a
nice mild mannered person, but I have screamed curses into this thing
like you wouldn't believe. And it really gets it out of your
system. It's cathartic. I might not be known as such a nice mild
manner person without this.</p>
<p>And this isn't exactly therapy, but talking into a recorder makes you
more comfortable talking to other people. It's private speaking
prepping for public speaking. When you listen to it later, you get
used to the sound of your voice, to the sound of your ideas. People
who are not used to the sound of their own voice always say they hate
it. But it's not like most of us have these awful voices. We're just
not use to hearing them.</p>
<p>4. Audiodiary.. When I was a teenager, I sometimes kept a diary. I
tended to make entries in my diary only when some awful crisis was
going on, and then when things calmed down, I'd be so embarrassed by
what I'd written that I'd tear the whole thing up. The great thing
about carrying around an audio recorder with you on a regular basis is
that it gives you a way to keep a much more even keel diary, that more
accurately reflects the full range of your experience. It's not just
crisis mode. In terms of self-improvement, this wider spectrum gives
you a much better basis of self-knowledge on which to act. The
downside is that it's a little boring, but my god, when it's your own
boring stuff, it's mesmerizing.


</p><p>OK, so much for seconds scale audiodidact. What about minutes?</p>
<p>This I started much more recently, just this year in fact. The idea
is that forcing myself to talk about something for a slightly longer
period of time might make me consider it more deeply. So for the last
few months, I've been giving myself a topic every morning, and then
talking about it into my recorder for seven solid minutes. Seven was a
compromise between depth and getting to work on time. The topic could
be a book I'm reading, or a friend, or a problem I'm trying to
solve. I try to keep rambling to a minimum and really focus on the
topic, the point is to go a little deeper than with the seconds
scale. I think it's too early to report on how useful this minutes
scale audiodidact will be, but the initial signs are promising.</p>
<p>As I've mentioned in previous podcasts, I'm learning and practicing
a bunch of foreign languages, so I'm using this minutes scale
audiodidact to help with that by alternating the language I use every
day for my 7 minute recording. Although I might lose a little in terms
of profundity of thought in a foreign language, it's a great way to
actually practice speaking the language. And you have this record of
your progress (at least hopefully there's progress). My dream is that
years from now I'll be able to listen to some of my earliest
recordings of me speaking Hebrew or french, contrast them with my
latest, and be amazed at the progress I've made. We'll see. My
foreign language topics tend to be a little more mundane than my
English language ones. I might just describe what I'm seeing around me
in the room I'm in. I might just do a common scenario, like an
introduction, talking about myself, my wife, my kid, my cats, etc. And
when I listen to it I can hear what I need to work on most.</p>
<p>The last thing I use audiodidact output for ties in with input. I
read books out loud into my recorder and then listen to them. I only
do this with books that are particularly difficult, or important or
beautiful, that I really want to pay serious attention to. And more
mundane texts in foreign languages I want to practice. For example,
I've been reading the King James Bible, and the Martin Luther bible in
German, and some Plato and Xenophon and Shakespeare and Nietzsche. If
I weren't reading out load, I simply couldn't force myself to give
these books the serious attention they require. I'd be too beat from
being a father and working full time. My mind would inevitably
wander. But by reading out load, with an imaginary audience -- my tape
recorder -- my mind doesn't wander, I can give real attention, it's
like I'm giving a performance. And the recorder is key to this
attention. Back in college I'd been very impressed when I read that
Abraham Lincoln read everything out loud, and that apparently this is
what helped make him such a great orator. But I quickly discovered
that it is possible to read out loud without paying the slightest
attention to a word you are saying. You need to have an audience --
real or imagined. And with the voice recorder, you do. That fact that
you can then listen again to it later is nice, but it's almost more
important as a psychological trick for getting you to pay attention
the first time around.</p>
<p>That's all for now. Thanks for listening.</p>
