<p>Hi, this is Reinhard from everydaysystems.com.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I talked about some systems for todo listing on
various levels: chain of self command and personal punch cards. The
basic idea of chain of self command was to associate tasks of
different magnitudes with different granularities of calendar time: a
year for big tasks, a month for medium tasks, a day for little
tasks. Personal punch cards are a concrete implementation of this
general idea: you use index cards corresponding to each of these
calendar units. An index card for each day, and index card for each
month, and one or more index cards for each big picture year-long goal
or problem that you want to attack. There was a bit more to it, and if
this sounds at all intriguing to you I encourage you to dig up those
podcasts. But today I'm going to focus on the daily todo list. In fact
I'm going to focus in even more narrowly on the individual daily todo
item. The task.</p>
<p>The question I'm going to examine is: when you write down a task on
your daily todo list, should you try to break it up into as many
atomic subtasks as possible, or should you try to glue together
several related subtasks into a single compound supertask?</p>
<p>The answer is, of course, that it depends. And what it depends on
most, I think, is whether the task in question is something routine,
that you do every day, or a one-off, a novel or unique task. Routines
should be compound, one-offs should be atomic. Here's why.</p>
<p>Routines, stuff you do or want to do every day, tend to be things
you understand well. You know how long they will take. They are not
surprising. You understand the associations between routine tasks, if
they exist. So it makes sense to stick them together if you can,
because then instead of having to remember or write down five things,
you can get away with only having to remember or write down one. For
example, I need to feed my cats every morning. I also need to give
them water. I also need to scoop their litter. I could make these
things separate tasks, but it's easy and convenient and natural to
regard them as one supertask. Here's another example. After I do my
exercise routine, shovelglove, it would be a good idea for me to
shower. While I'm at it, I might as well shave. And cut my nails. So
these 4 things make one natural compound task. I should probably add
"floss" too, but I'm not quite there yet.</p>
<p>What do I gain by consolidating these 7 tasks into just 2? Well,
for one thing, I'm more likely to remember to do all of them. All I
have to do is remember one of the components and I've go the whole
bundle. "cats" or "exercise" or "shower." I know some of them sound
like basic things that any reasonably socialized non lunatic would do
without systematic intervention, but I can get astonishingly forgetful
when I'm in a rush, and I don't think I'm the only one. It also puts
some extra pressure on you to do some of the important but seemingly
optional stuff along with the basic necessities. Most of us wouldn't
leave the house without showering (I hope). But far too many of us
leave the house without exercising. If you bundle exercise and shower,
the exercise becomes non-optional. All of a sudden you can't leave the
house without exercising. This is a really simple, but really powerful
motivator. And it's very natural. The association already exists,
you're just formalizing and strengthening it.</p>
<p>I also, if you remember from my punch cards segment, have just ten
rows in my "routine" column on my daily index card, and I don't want
to blow 70% of them on my cats and basic personal hygiene. You could
say that's an artificial constraint, the number of lines on an index
card, and maybe that's true, but it's still an important
constraint. Because the number of tasks makes a difference, even apart
from the actually amount of cumulative work this corresponds to. If
the number of tasks gets too high, you start to lose track, even if
you're writing everything down. You want to keep it to a manageable
level. X amount of work divided into 10 tasks is easier to deal with
than X amount of work divided into a thousand tasks.</p>
<p>I don't know if this is necessary, but you can also come up with
silly mnemonic names for compound tasks, just by glomming words or
word parts together. So shovelglove plus shower plus shave plus nails
becomes "shoshoshana" which sounds vaguely Hebrew, which I am also
studying, incidentally. This makes it super hard to forget what the
component tasks are, and even gives you a clue as to the order in
which they are to be performed. And it's compact. It's easy to write
down or just remember.</p>
<p>The danger with compound tasks like this is that you will overwhelm
yourself with monstrously hard quadruple decker tasks. That's why I
only recommend it for routine tasks that you understand very well. You
know how long they're going to take, and you know how they fit
together. For one off or novel tasks that you don't really know how
long they'll take, I recommend the opposite: break them up into as
many small parts as possible.</p>
<p>I've found that novel tasks almost always take longer than you
think. By breaking them up into tiny parts, you factor this extra time
into your plans. You're less likely to overextend yourself. Some one
off tasks, like sending an email to someone, might be easier to judge,
but it still makes sense to keep them nice and atomic because it
doesn't have any natural associations with other tasks that will help
you bundle it. Plus if you segregate your routine and one off tasks,
as I do with my personal punch cards, filling up a row with a little
task helps compensate for the inevitable other row that is going to
take much longer than you think. And you want to fill these rows with
as many easy, well understood things as will fit, both to keep hard
poorly understood things from sneaking in and overwhelming you, and to
give you a motivating sense of progress as you cross these things
off. I've found that a sense of progress, even a somewhat artificial
sense of progress, motivates me to get more done. </p>
<p>My daily punch cards have three columns: work, routine, and
errand. Routine is obviously routine, but work and errand are one
offs. Some of the tasks in my work and errand columns are ridiculously
small. It might seem like I'm just tyring to fill up these columns to
make it look like I'm accomplishing something. And that's true. But in
the process of wanting to seem effective by crossing off lots of tiny
little accomplishments, I wind up getting much more done than I used
to. I like to have at least 7 tasks in each column (and no more than
10). This is the sweet spot between ambition and complacency that
keeps me moving at a rapid but sustainable clip. If I write down at
least 7 tasks in each column and get them all done, I give myself a
little star on that card, kind of like the psycho schoolteacher played
by Judy Dench in Notes on a Scandal. Very motivating. Just imagine her
saying "gold star day."</p>
<p>Well, I'm out of time. Hope some of this was useful. Thanks for
listening.</p>
