<p>Hi, this is Reinhard from everydaysystems.com.  All the systems
I've been talking about involve following simple rules. Today I'm
going to talk about the importance of strictness in following these
rules. </p>
<p>Strictness sounds so old fashioned. Unpleasant. Like a mean
schoolmarm. It also sounds hard.</p>
<p>And it can be all off those things. But it can also be a great and
necessary help if you're strict about the right things in the right
way.</p>
<p>There are three issues related to strictness. 1) how strict should
you be? 2) what should you be strict about and 3) does strictness
involve punishment or restitution of some kind</p>
<p>The first issue, how strict should you be, is the most basic,
because it includes the question should you be strict at all? Right,
the least degree of strictness, is 0 strictness.</p>
<p>The basic case for strictness, to take you beyond 0, is this:
strictness builds habit faster. If you are strict, your appetites
learn fast that it's not worth testing the boundaries all the
time. Your habits are like children, or animals. If you are not
strict, or inconsistent, they'll constantly be testing, seeing how far
they can go, and you'll actually have to use more willpower to resist
them. So paradoxically, strictness makes it easier. It's being lenient
that's hard.</p>
<p>So how strict should you be? Well, the stricter you are, the faster
your habits learn.</p>
<p>The most important time for strictness is at the beginning, when
you're habit is new. When your habit is old, strictness isn't really
much of an issue. The habit does what's right automatically. It's
internalized the strictness.</p>
<p>OK, issue number 2. What should you be strict about?<p>
<p>There's a Jewish expression, "Fence around the Law," which means
don't do anything that might possibly be interpreted as giving even
the appearance of violating sacred law. The idea is that sometimes
it's hard to know precisely when an important moral or religious line
is being crossed, so draw another line farther out. That far out line
may be a little arbitrary, but it's very clear, and if you stop things
at that level, you can be confident they haven't crossed a more
important, but more ambiguous boundary. And because the far out line
is very clear, it's easy to make fast, snap decisions. A scholar might
have the luxury of contemplating the deep subtleties of the underlying
law, but for ordinary observant Jews in daily life, that "fence around
the law" clarity is critical because otherwise how could they make the
hundreds of decisions they have to make every day.</p>
<p>I hope no one will consider it blasphemous that I apply this
principle to profane matters like weight loss and exercise, because I
think it's a profound and useful psychological insight, and it's with
great respect that I re-purpose it here.<p>
<p>The real problem we're trying to deal with is often very murky and
hard to put our finger on. Overeating, if you want to think about it
forever, is infinitely complex. We need to build clear unambiguous
fences around that problem so we can quickly make sharp distinctions
about how to behave to avoid it. Because otherwise it's like 40 times
a day you have to be a Talmud scholar to know what to do. Which is,
more or less, what many diet systems demand of you. </p>
<p>So be strict about things that are very clear. The literal rules of
the no-s diet, for example. It's both easier to be strict about things
that are clear, and it's more effective. You don't have to agonize so
much about what you have to be strict about, it's obvious, and dumb
habit learns simple rules faster. </p>
<p>In some individual cases, the literal rules may seem silly. Like
not eating an orange between meals. Or that mountainous single plate of
junk food you're about to eat. But big picture the rules make a lot of
sense, and you don't want to trade the big picture "good enough" for
little picture perfection. Because when you make exceptions you
sacrifice clarity. And when you sacrifice clarity you sacrifice
habit. And without habit, the whole enterprise is hopeless.</p>
<p>Issue number three: punishment and restitution.</p>
<p>Strictness does not mean punishment. Nor does it mean making up for
it when you screw up. It just means being very clear as to what
constitutes success and failure, trying your best to meet the criteria
for success, and being honest with yourself when you mess up.</p>
<p>Punishment and restitution are actually bad and
counterproductive. I don't say this from some kind of mushy "love
yourself" "I'm OK, your OK" persepctive -- on the contrary. I say this
because when you punish yourself or try to make amends for having
messed up, what you're really doing, at a deep psychological level, is
saying, "it's OK to fail because I can make up for failure later." You
think you're just paying off a debt, but you're also, and more
importantly, opening up a line of credit. That line of credit, that
idea that you can make up for failure in the future, will make you
much more likely to fail. You've lowered the stakes, you've lowered
the incentive to succeed.</p>
<p>If, on the other had, you know that you have just one chance to
behave correctly, that there is no make up test, you'll take your
behavior much more seriously, and you'll have much better odds of
succeeding the first and only time around.</p>
<p>So when you fail, the strict thing to do is just get up, brush off
the dust, pause to consider what you did wrong and how to avoid it in
the future, and move on. There's a pseudostatistic floating around on
the internet that it takes an average of 12 failures before you can
establish a major new habit like dieting. So don't be discouraged if
you wipe out a few times.</p>
<p>If that pseudostatistic is insufficiently inspiring, I'll close on
a more eloquent note with a quote from Winston Churchill (not,
admittedly, the thinnest man in the world, but he did have some pretty
serious problems that he managed to overcome, thank God):</p>
<p>"Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of
enthusiasm."</p>
<p>That's all for today. Thanks for listening.</p>
