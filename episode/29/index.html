<p>Hi, this is Reinhard from everydaysystems.com. I've been asked to
talk about the top five health and fitness books I've
read. Unfortunately I don't think I've read that many health and
fitness books in my entire life, and they certainly weren't all worth
recommending. So I'm going to have to narrow it down to four. And I'll
be cheating a little because one of them hasn't even been published
yet.</p>
<p>Recommendation #1: Mindless Eating by Brian Wansink of the Cornell
food and brand lab. In this book, the author describes the
experiments he has done to figure out the environmental cues that make
people mindlessly overeat and how you can reengineer your life to just
as mindlessly avoid them. Example: he did this one experiment where he
fed people soup except there was secretly a hose attached to the bowl
that kept refilling it, it was a bottomless soup bowl. People kept
eating and eating because they didn't get the visual cue of an empty
bowl to tell them to stop. Another example: when products are marketed
as healthy, people eat more of them because they think, hey, it's
healthy. They'll even go on to eat more of some obviously unhealthy
food because they think, hey, I just ate something healthy, I've got
virtue to burn -- they feel blessed by this contact with the healthy
food. This is called the healthy halo effect. And it's obviously very
unhealthy. There are a lot more great little tidbits like these. It's
very entertaining reading, if nothing else. My problem with the book
is that the pitfalls get a lot more attention than the
solutions. Although seeing how silly these behaviors of ours are is in
itself a step toward a solution.
<p>For my second recommendation I'm not going to recommend a
particular book, but a class of books. Any normal cookbook. Not a diet
cookbook, not a healthy cook book, but a regular old fashioned
cookbook where the emphasis is on food that tastes good. Preparing
recipes from any cookbook is likely to lose you weight over the long
run. Why?  Because when you cook you eat in. And when you eat in,
you'll usually eat less food than you will at restaurants with their
increasingly enormous portions. Normal cookbooks, cookbooks that make
no pretensions to healthfulness, are much better than diet cookbooks
in terms of weight management because their recipes taste good enough
that you'll actually make them. Healthy recipes that you never make or
avoid eating because you don't enjoy them are bad for your health,
because they keep you from cooking and prompt you to eat out -- to
overeat out -- instead. It is much better to see the stick of butter
your putting into your home cooked mashed potatoes than not see the 2
sticks of trans fat they're stuffing into your restaurant mystery
meal.</p>
<p>Recommendation #3: the autobiography of Ben Franklin. This guy took
what he saw as moral problems -- among them, gluttony and sloth,
seriously. But not dreadfully seriously. He saw that he had these
problems and he saw that they were serious and that yes, they were his
fault, but he didn't get all depresseed and moan about them. He was
cheerful and practical about solving them. He treated self improvement
like a game. Yes, the stakes are high, but that doesn't mean you can't
have fun. You may have heard about how he made a list of 13 virtues
that he wanted to cultivate. He'd cycle through this list, focusing on
one virtue a week and ticking off any infractions in a kind of
ledger. It's a great approach. It's a great attitude. And if you want
to do something similar, I just set up a free online habit calendar at
everydaysystems.com called HabitCal to provide a bit of helpful
infrastructure.</p>
<p>Recommendation #4: my book, of course, the No S Diet. Last I heard
it was due to be published in spring 2008, but I'm a few months ahead
of schedule in terms of the writing, so maybe that'll translate to an
earlier release date. I have no idea. This book has a great
gimmick. The entire rule system fits on the cover: no snacks, no
sweets, no seconds, -- except on days that start with S. You could
look at the cover (or listen to what I just said), walk away, and
start losing weight. So why buy the book?  Not to be blaspehmous, but
it's a little like saying why should I buy the bible when I already
know the 10 commandments? It's hard to stick to those rules, simple and right as they are. The nos
diet book covers all the possible excuses your stubborn sneaky mind is
going to come up with to get out of following them. So among other
things, I give a whole chapter to each rule (and the exception). There's a lot more stuff in there too, like
a chapter on habit management, which I've touched on a bit in these
podcasts, but not in the same depth.</p>
<p>Well, that's it. Two actual books. One category of books. And one
as of yet non-existent book. Thanks for listening.</p>
