<p>Hi, this is Reinhard from everyday systems.com. </p>
<p>Last week, I talked about how one of the behaviors that isn't
possible to automate into unconscious habit is keeping track of
stuff. Some examples of popular self help behaviors behaviors that
like this are counting calories or food journaling. You can't do it
unconsciously, so you can't make it a habit. None of my everyday
systems require you to keep track of anything besides the day of the
week or what planet you're on.
<p>The question I'm going to pose today is: even though none of the
everyday systems behaviors requires you to keep track of anything as
part of the behavior, is it worth, maybe, keeping track of the
behaviors themselves?</p>
<p>In other words, let's say your doing the no s diet. The no s diet
doesn't require you to count anything. But every day, you either stick
with it, or you don't (or it's an S day). You succeed, or you fail (or
you're exempt because it's an S day). Is it worth counting these
successes, failures, and exemptions? That's what I mean by tracking
the behavior.</p>
<p>Keeping track is an expense. So when you do it, you'd like to
really make sure the benefit is greater than the expense. Generally
speaking, I think people underestimate the expense of keeping track,
because it always starts out kind of fun. A new self improvement
project. Exciting. You're learning something about yourself. But you
learn what you're gonna learn really fast, and it gets very boring and
stays just as time consuming.</p>
<p>So I like to try to overestimate the expense of keeping track, just
to balance out this natural human tendency. I'm going to ask, not just
what is the benefit of keeping track, but how can I make the expense
as small as possible and still get that benefit?</p>
<p>So what precisely am I proposing you keep track of? I call it the
habit traffic light. Each of the systems I've talked about has some
simple rules for how to behave. Every day, you either abide by the
rules, or you don't, or if the systems has S days like the nosdiet and
shovelglove, there's a third possibility, you could be exempt. You
could take a calendar, and make a green mark on every day you succeed,
a red mark on every day you fail, and a yellow mark on exempt
days. Green/Yellow/Red -- like a traffic light. It's not a whole lot
of effort keep track of this, there's just one data point per day, and
at the end of the month you'd have a very striking picture --
literally, a picture -- of how well you adhered to your behavior. Some
people don't like the word "failure." I actually do... but I don't
have time to convince you of it's merits today. For now, just
substitute your preferred euphemism. Call it a "slip up" or
something.</p>
<p>I guess I should say we have a forum in the everyday systems
bulletin board just for people posting daily checkins like this. A
paper calender would do just fine, but posting to the bulletin board,
gives you a slightly more powerful sense of accountability, support
from other people doing the same thing, and if you're at all
altruistic, it's a generous thing to do because other people who come
to the site can see examples of what it looks like to struggle with
one of these habits. The con, right now, is it's not a visually
compelling as an actual calendar, but I'm working on that. I hope to
have a habit calendar section of the website available soon that would
combine the benefits of the bulletin board with the paper
calendar..</p>
<p>So the cost is pretty minimal. Only one simple data point per habit
per day. But it's still a cost. It's more than nothing. So let's
consider what you get for it.
<p>I think the benefit is primarily motivational. For one thing, it
gives you the illusion of accountability. And that illusion, can be
powerful. By recording failures, you can't as easily pretend they
didn't happen, it's harder to just conveniently forget that you
screwed up three days running, and that raises the stakes. More
positively, once you have a few green success days under your belt,
you don't want to break your winning streak. You feel like you've
accumulated something that would be a shame to throw away. </p>
<p>A second benefit is diagnostic. Let's say you've done the nos
diet three months, and you haven't lost any weight. You look at the
calendar and see a lot of red. Well, it's no mystery why you didn't
lose weight. You simply didn't do what you were supposed to do. If, on
the other had, it's solid green (with a bit of s day yellow) then you
can go digging for more profound and subtle explanations. </p>
<p>A third benefit is that if you feel the need to keep track of
something, and I think a lot of people do, at least keeping track of
days on habit keeps you focused on behavior, not results. It indulges
your "must keep track of something" urge without distracting you from
what is directly under your control. Otherwise you might focus on
something like the number on the scale, which, while it is ultimately
determined by behavior, won't move in lock step with it, and that can
make you feel powerless and discouraged when you've been good, but the
scale doesn't immediately reflect your good behavior. Which seems to
me the rule rather than the exception. Behavior takes time to
translate into results. And when you focus on results, you lose sight
of this, and get discouraged.</p>
<p>A fourth benefit is that, compared to other scoring systems, the
habit traffic light encourages you to consistently strive for a
sustainable minimum of compliance, rather than heroically
overreaching. The best thing you can get with the habit traffic light
is "success." There's no double success or triple success. And this is
important. The goal is regularity. A daily "good enough." You don't
want some more complex point system that encourages you to balance
terrible days with extra good ones. Because then all you're doing with
your extra virtue is buying the right for extra vice, and vice versa,
to make a stupid pun. You will get yourself into massive debt that
way, wracking up huge vices that you kid yourself into thinking your
going to pay off one day by being extra good. It's like the medieval
practice of selling indulgences. It was a bad idea then, it's a bad
idea now.</p>
<p>The habit traffic light deprives you of a very seductive excuse --
that you can cheat because you can make up for it later. The knowledge
that there is no make up test, that you have only one chance to do
each day right, will make you that much more serious about passing the
first and only time around.</p>
<p>It looks like I'm out of time for today. I have a bit more to say
about habit tracking, but I'll have to save it for next
week. Specifically, I'll address the issue of how long should you
continue tracking your habit. Does it make sense to stop after a
certain point, or to start tracking it in a slightly different
way. Thanks for listening.</p>
